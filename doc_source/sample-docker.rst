Docker Sample for |AC9long|
###########################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides a hands-on sample that you can use to experiment with Docker in AWS Cloud9.

This sample shows you how to connect an |envfirstlongssh| to a running Docker container inside of an Amazon Linux instance in |EC2|.
This enables you to use the |AC9IDE| to work with code and files inside of a Docker container and to run commands on that container.
For information about Docker, see `What is Docker <https://www.docker.com/what-docker>`_ on the Docker website.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as |EC2|. For more information, see
`Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_.

* :ref:`sample-docker-install`
* :ref:`sample-docker-build`
* :ref:`sample-docker-run`
* :ref:`sample-docker-env`
* :ref:`sample-docker-code`
* :ref:`sample-docker-clean-up`

.. _sample-docker-prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

* **You should have an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.** This sample assumes you already have an |EC2| instance running Amazon Linux in your AWS account.
  To launch an |EC2| instance, see `Launch a Linux Virtual Machine <https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/>`_.
  In the :guilabel:`Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)` page of the wizard, choose an AMI whose display name starts with :guilabel:`Amazon Linux AMI`.
* **If the Amazon EC2 instance runs within an Amazon VPC, there are additional requirements.** See :ref:`vpc-settings`.
* **The Amazon EC2 instance should have at least 8 to 16 GB of free disk space available.** This sample uses Docker images that are over 3 GB in size and can use additional
  increments of 3 GB or more of disk space to build images. If you try to run this sample on
  a disk that has 8 GB of free space or less, we've found that the Docker image might not build or the Docker container might not run. To check the instance's
  free disk space, you can run a command such as :command:`df -h` (for "disk filesystem information in human-readable format") on the instance.
  To increase an existing instance's disk size, see :EC2-ug:`Modifying a Volume <ebs-modify-volume>` in the |EC2-ug|.

.. _sample-docker-install:

Step 1: Install and Run Docker
==============================

In this step, you check if Docker is installed on the |EC2| instance, and install Docker if it isn't already installed. After you install Docker, you run it on
the instance.

#. Connect to the running |EC2| instance by using an SSH client such as the :command:`ssh` utility or PuTTY. To do this, see
   "Step 3: Connect to Your Instance" in `Launch a Linux Virtual Machine <https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/>`_.
#. Check if Docker is installed on the instance. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command on the instance with the :command:`--version` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      docker --version

   If Docker is installed, the Docker version and build number are displayed. In this case, skip ahead to step 5 later in this procedure.

#. Install Docker. To do this, run the :command:`yum` command with the :command:`install` action, specifying the :command:`docker` package to install.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y docker

#. Confirm that Docker is installed. To do this, run the :command:`docker --version` command again. The Docker version and build number are displayed.
#. Run Docker. To do this, run the :command:`service` command with the :command:`docker` service and the :command:`start` action.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo service docker start

#. Confirm Docker is running. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command with the :command:`info` action.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker info

   If Docker is running, information about Docker is displayed.

.. _sample-docker-build:

Step 2: Build the Image
=======================

In this step, you use a Dockerfile to build a Docker image onto the instance. This sample uses an image that includes Node.js and a sample chat server application.

#. On the instance, create the Dockerfile. To do this, with the SSH client still connected to the instance,
   in the :file:`/tmp` directory on the instance, create a file named :file:`Dockerfile`. For example, run the :command:`touch` command as follows.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo touch /tmp/Dockerfile

#. Add the following contents to the :file:`Dockerfile` file.

   .. code-block:: text

      # Build a Docker image based on the cloud9/ws-nodejs Docker image.
      FROM cloud9/ws-nodejs

      # Enable the Docker container to communicate with AWS Cloud9 by
      # installing SSH.
      RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssh-server

      # Ensure that Node.js is installed.
      RUN apt-get install -y nodejs && ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

      # Disable password authentication by turning off the
      # Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM).
      RUN sed -i 's/UsePAM yes/UsePAM no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

      # Add the AWS Cloud9 SSH public key to the Docker container.
      # This assumes a file named authorized_keys containing the
      # AWS Cloud9 SSH public key already exists in the same
      # directory as the Dockerfile.
      RUN mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.ssh
      ADD ./authorized_keys /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys
      RUN chown -R ubuntu /home/ubuntu/.ssh /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys && \
      chmod 700 /home/ubuntu/.ssh && \
      chmod 600 /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys

      # Start SSH in the Docker container.
      CMD /usr/sbin/sshd -D

      # Update the password to a random one for the user ubuntu.
      RUN echo "ubuntu:$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)" | chpasswd

   To add the preceding contents to the :file:`Dockerfile` file, you could use the :command:`vi` utility on the instance as follows.

   #. Use :command:`vi` to open the :code:`/tmp/Dockerfile` file.

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo vi /tmp/Dockerfile

   #. Paste the preceding contents into the :file:`Dockerfile` file. If you're not sure how to do this, see your SSH client's documentation.
   #. Switch to command mode. To do this, press the :kbd:`Esc` key. (:code:`-- INSERT --` disappears from the bottom of the window.)
   #. Type :code:`:wq` (to write to the :file:`/tmp/Dockerfile` file, save the file, and then exit :command:`vi`), and then press :kbd:`Enter`.

   .. note:: Some additional Docker images are available in the `c9/templates <https://github.com/c9/templates>`_ repository on the GitHub website.
      The following table lists the available images and their content and definitions. To use a different Docker image from this repository, replace
      :code:`cloud9/ws-nodejs` in the Dockerfile with one of the following image IDs.

#. On the instance, create a file that contains the |AC9| SSH public key for the Docker container to use. To do this, in the same directory as the :file:`Dockerfile` file,
   create a file named :file:`authorized_keys`, for example, by running the :command:`touch` command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo touch /tmp/authorized_keys

#. Add the |AC9| SSH public key to the :file:`authorized_keys` file. To get the |AC9| SSH public key, do the following:

   #. Open the |AC9| console at |AC9Console_link|.
   #. In the AWS navigation bar, in the AWS Region selector, choose the AWS Region where you'll want to create the |envfirstlong| later in this topic.
   #. If a welcome page is displayed, for :guilabel:`New AWS Cloud9 environment`, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`. Otherwise, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Name environment` page, for :guilabel:`Name`, type a name for the |env|. (The name doesn't matter here. You'll choose a different name later.)
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Next step`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Environment type`, choose :guilabel:`Connect and run in remote server (SSH)`.
   #. Expand :guilabel:`View public SSH key`.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Copy key to clipboard`. (This is between :guilabel:`View public SSH key` and :guilabel:`Advanced settings`.)
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Cancel`.
   #. Paste the contents of the clipboard into the :file:`authorized_keys` file, and then save the file. For example, you can use the :command:`vi` utility, as described earlier in this step.

#. Build the image by running the :command:`docker` command with the :command:`build` action, adding the tag :code:`cloud9-image:latest` to the image and
   specifying the path to the :file:`Dockerfile` file to use.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker build -t cloud9-image:latest /tmp

   If successful, the last two lines of the build output display :code:`Successfully built` and :code:`Successfully tagged`.

   To confirm that Docker successfully built the image, run the :command:`docker` command with the :code:`image ls` action.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker image ls

   If successful, the output displays an entry where the :code:`REPOSITORY` field is set to :code:`cloud9-image` and the :code:`TAG` field is set to :code:`latest`.

#. Make a note of the |EC2| instance's public IP address. You'll need it for :ref:`sample-docker-env`. If you're not sure what the public IP address of the instance is,
   you can run the following command on the instance to get it.

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

.. _sample-docker-run:

Step 3: Run the Container
=========================

In this step, you run a Docker container on the instance. This container is based on the image you built in the previous step.

#. To run the Docker container, run the :command:`docker` command on the instance with the :command:`run` action and the following options.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker run -d -it --expose 9090 -p 0.0.0.0:9090:22 --name cloud9 cloud9-image:latest

   * :code:`-d` runs the container in detached mode, exiting whenever the root process that is used to run the container (in this sample, the SSH client) exits.
   * :code:`-it` runs the container with an allocated pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, even if the container is not attached.
   * :code:`--expose` makes the specified port (in this sample, port :code:`9090`) available from the container.
   * :code:`-p` makes the specified port available internally to the |EC2| instance over the specified IP address and port. In this sample, port :code:`9090` on the container can be accessed
     internally through port :code:`22` on the |EC2| instance.
   * :code:`--name` is a human-readable name for the container (in this sample, :code:`cloud9`).
   * :code:`cloud9-image:latest` is the human-readable name of the built image to use to run the container.

   To confirm that Docker is successfully running the container, run the :command:`docker` command with the :code:`container ls` action.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker container ls

   If successful, the output displays an entry where the :code:`IMAGE` field is set to :code:`cloud9-image:latest` and the :code:`NAMES` field is set to :code:`cloud9`.

#. Log in to the running container. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command with the :command:`exec` action and the following options.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker exec -it cloud9 bash

   * :code:`-it` runs the container with an allocated pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, even if the container isn't attached.
   * :code:`cloud9` is the human-readable name of the running container.
   * :code:`bash` starts the standard shell in the running container.

   If successful, the terminal prompt changes to display the logged-in user's name for the container and the ID of the container.

   .. note:: If you ever want to log out of the running container, run the :command:`exit` command. The terminal prompt changes back to display the logged-in user's name for the instance and
      the private DNS of the instance. The container should still be running.

#. For the directory on the running container that you want |AC9| to start from after it logs in, set its access permissions to
   :command:`rwxr-xr-x`. This means read-write-execute permissions for the owner, read-execute permissions for the group, and read-execute permissions for others. For example,
   if the directory's path is :file:`~`, you can set these permissions on the directory by running the :command:`chmod` command in the running container as follows.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx ~

#. Make a note of the path to the directory on the running container that contains the Node.js binary, as you'll need it for :ref:`sample-docker-env`.
   If you're not sure what this path is, run the following command on the running container to get it.

   .. code-block:: sh

      which node

.. _sample-docker-env:

Step 4: Create the |envtitle|
=============================

In this step, you use |AC9| to create an |envfirstlongssh| and connect it to the running Docker container. After |AC9| creates the
environment, it displays the |AC9IDE| so that you can start working with the files and code in the container.

#. Open the |AC9| console, if it isn't already open, at |AC9Console_link|.
#. In the AWS navigation bar, in the AWS Region selector, choose the AWS Region where you want to create the |envssh|.
#. If a welcome page is displayed, for :guilabel:`New AWS Cloud9 environment`, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`. Otherwise, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Name environment` page, for :guilabel:`Name`, type a name for the |env|.
#. To add a description to the |env|, type it in :guilabel:`Description`.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next step`.
#. For :guilabel:`Environment type:`, choose :guilabel:`Connect and run in remote server (SSH)`.
#. For :guilabel:`User`, type :code:`ubuntu`.
#. For :guilabel:`Host`, type the pubic IP address of the |EC2| instance, which you noted earlier.
#. For :guilabel:`Port`, type :code:`9090`.
#. Expand :guilabel:`Advanced settings`.
#. For :guilabel:`Environment path`, type the path to the directory on the running container that you want |AC9| to start from after it logs in.
#. For :guilabel:`Node.js binary path`, type the path to the directory on the running container that contains the Node.js binary, which you noted earlier.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next step`.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Create environment`.
#. When the :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9 Installer` dialog box appears, choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. In the list of components to be installed, clear the :guilabel:`c9.ide.lambda.docker` check box, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`. This is because |AC9| cannot run Docker inside of Docker.
#. When the :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9 Installer` dialog box displays :guilabel:`Installation Completed`, choose :guilabel:`Next`, and then choose :guilabel:`Finish`.
   The |AC9IDE| appears for the running container, and you can start working with the container's files and code.

.. note:: If the container stops running, you can no longer use the |IDE| to access the container until you start running the container again.
   To do this, go back to :ref:`sample-docker-run`.

.. _sample-docker-code:

Step 5: Run the Code
====================

In this step, you use the |AC9IDE| to run a sample application inside the running Docker container.

#. With the |AC9IDE| displayed for the running container, start the sample chat server. To do this,
   in the :guilabel:`Environment` window, right-click the sample :file:`workspace/server.js` file, and then choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. Preview the sample application. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Environment` window, open the
   the :file:`workspace/client/index.html` file. Then, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Tools, Preview, Preview Running Application`.
#. On the application preview tab, for :guilabel:`Your Name`, type your name. For :guilabel:`Message`, type a message.
   Then choose :guilabel:`Send`. The chat server adds your name and message to the list.

.. _sample-docker-clean-up:

Step 6: Clean Up
================

In this step, you delete the |env| and remove |AC9| and Docker support files from the |EC2| instance.
Also, to prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should terminate the |EC2| instance that is running Docker.

Step 6.1: Delete the |envtitle|
-------------------------------

To delete the |env|, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.

Step 6.2: Remove |AC9| Support Files from the Container
-------------------------------------------------------

After you delete the |env|, some |AC9| support files still remain in the container. If you want to keep using the container but no longer
need these support files, delete the :file:`.c9` folder from the directory on the container that you specified |AC9| to start from after it logs in.
For example, if the directory is :file:`~`, run the :command:`rm` command with the :command:`-r` option as follows.

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo rm -r ~/.c9

Step 6.3: Remove Docker Support Files from the Instance
-------------------------------------------------------

If you no longer want to keep the Docker container, the Docker image, and Docker on the |EC2| instance, but you want to keep the instance, you
can remove these Docker support files as follows.

#. Remove the Docker container from the instance. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command on the instance
   with the :command:`stop` and :command:`rm` stop actions and the human-readable name of the container.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker stop cloud9
      sudo docker rm cloud9

#. Remove the Docker image from the instance. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command on the instance
   with the :command:`image rm` action and the image's tag.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker image rm cloud9-image:latest

#. Remove any additional Docker support files that might still exit. To do this, run the :command:`docker` command on the instance
   with the :command:`system prune` action.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo docker system prune -a

#. Uninstall Docker. To do this, run the :command:`yum` command on the instance with the :command:`remove` action, specifying the
   :command:`docker` package to uninstall.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y remove docker

   You can also remove the :file:`Dockerfile` and :file:`authorized_keys` files you created earlier. For example, run the
   :command:`rm` command on the instance.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo rm /tmp/Dockerfile
      sudo rm /tmp/authorized_keys

Step 6.4: Terminate the Instance
--------------------------------

To terminate the |EC2| instance, see :EC2-ug:`Terminate Your Instance <terminating-instances>` in the |EC2-ug|.
