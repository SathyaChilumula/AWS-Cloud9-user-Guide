What Is |AC9long|?
##################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides an introduction to AWS Cloud9.

|AC9| contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, debug, and
release software in the cloud. To work with these tools, you use the 
|AC9| integrated development environment, or :dfn:`IDE`.

You access the |AC9IDE| through a web browser. The |IDE| offers a rich code-editing experience with
support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, as well as a built-in
terminal.

You can configure the |IDE| to your preferences. You can switch color themes, bind shortcut keys,
enable programming language-specific syntax coloring and code formatting, and more.

How Does |AC9| Work?
====================

The following diagram shows a high-level overview of how |AC9| works.

.. image:: images/arch.png
   :alt: Diagram that provides an overview of how AWS Cloud9 works

You use the |AC9IDE|, running in a web browser on your local computer, to interact with your |env|. A cloud compute instance (for example an |EC2| instance) 
or your own server connects to the |env|. An :dfn:`environment` is a place where you store your project's files and where you run the tools to develop your apps.

You use the |AC9IDE| to work with files in the |env|. You can:

* Store these files locally on the instance or server.
* Clone a remote code repository |mdash| such as a repo in |ACClong| |mdash| into your |env|.
* Work with a combination of local and cloned files in the |env|.

In the background, you can instruct |AC9| to have |EC2| create an |EC2| instance and then connect the |env| to the newly-created instance. 
We call this type of setup an :dfn:`EC2 environment`. 
You can also instruct |AC9| to connect an |env| to an existing cloud compute instance or your own server. We call this type of setup an :dfn:`SSH environment`.

Here are the key similarities and differences between |envec2plural| and |envsshplural|.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **EC2 environments**
     - **SSH environments**
   * - |AC9| creates an associated |EC2| instance and manages that instance's lifecycle (for example, start, stop, and terminate).
     - You use an existing cloud compute instance or your own server. You manage that instance's or server's lifecycle.
   * - The instance runs on Amazon Linux.
     - You can use any cloud compute instance that runs Linux, or your own server running Linux.
   * - |AC9| automatically sets up the instance to start working with |AC9|.
     - You must manually configure the instance or your own server to work with |AC9|.
   * - |AC9| automatically sets up the |clilong| (|cli|) on the instance for you to start using.
     - If you want to use the |cli| on the instance or your own server, you must set it up yourself.
   * - The instance has access to hundreds of useful packages, with some common packages already installed and configured, such as Git, Docker, Node.js, and Python.
     - You might need to download, install, and configure additional packages to complete common tasks.
   * - You maintain the instance, for example by periodically applying system updates.
     - You maintain the instance or your own server.
   * - When you delete the |env|, |AC9| automatically terminates the associated instance.
     - When you delete the |env|, the instance or your own server remains.

You can create and switch between multiple |envplural|, 
with each |env| set up for a specific development project. By storing the |env| 
in the cloud, your projects no longer need to be tied to a single computer or server setup. This
enables you to do things such as easily switch between computers and more quickly onboard developers to your team.

.. _versions:

About Cloud9 Versions
=====================

There are currently two versions of Cloud9 available: c9.io and |AC9long|. This :title:`AWS Cloud9 User Guide` only covers |AC9long|.

c9.io is available only to existing c9.io users. For more information, 
see `Cloud9 now runs on and integrates with AWS <https://c9.io/announcement>`_ on the c9.io website.

c9.io and |AC9long| are not interoperable. You can't use an account or workspace in c9.io with an account or |env| in |AC9long|.
