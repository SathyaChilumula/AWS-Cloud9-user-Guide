|LAMlong| Tutorial for |AC9long|
################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides a hands-on tutorial that you can use to begin experimenting with AWS Lambda functions by using AWS Cloud9.

In this tutorial, you use the |AC9IDE| to create a function in |LAMlong| and an accompanying API in |ABPlong|. After you create the function and its API, you run and debug them locally.
Then you run the function and API in |LAM| and |ABP| in production.

.. note:: Completing this tutorial might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for |EC2|, |LAM|, and |ABP|.
   For more information, see
   `Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_, `AWS Lambda Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/>`_, and `Amazon API Gateway Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/>`_.

.. _tutorial-lambda-prereqs:

Prerequisites
=============

To successfully complete this tutorial, you must first complete the steps in :ref:`Express Setup <setup-express>` or :ref:`Team Setup <setup>`.

.. _tutorial-lambda-create-environment:

Step 1: Create and Open the |envtitle|
======================================

In this step, you use the |AC9| console to create and then open an |envfirst|.

If you already have an |env|, open it, and then skip ahead to :ref:`tutorial-lambda-create-function`.

In |AC9|, a :dfn:`development environment` (or just :dfn:`environment`) is a place where you store your development project's files and where you run the tools to develop your apps. 
In this tutorial, you create a special kind of |env| called an :dfn:`EC2 environment`. For this kind of |env|, |AC9| launches and manages a new |EC2| instance running Amazon Linux, 
creates the |env|, and then connects the |env| to the newly-launched instance. When you open the |env|, |AC9| displays the |AC9IDE| that enables you to work with the files and tools in that |env|.

#. Sign in to |AC9| console, at |AC9Console_link|.
#. In the top navigation bar, choose the AWS Region to create the |env| in.

   .. image:: images/console-region.png
      :alt: AWS Region selector in the AWS Cloud9 console

#. If a welcome page is displayed, for :guilabel:`New AWS Cloud9 environment`, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`.
   Otherwise, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`.

   .. image:: images/console-welcome-new-env.png
      :alt: Welcome page in the AWS Cloud9 console

   Or:

   .. image:: images/console-new-env.png
      :alt: Create environment button in the AWS Cloud9 console

#. On the :guilabel:`Name environment` page, for :guilabel:`Name`, type a name for your |env| (for example, :code:`my-lambda-environment`).
#. For :guilabel:`Description`, type something about your |env| (for example, :code:`This environment is for the AWS Cloud9 tutorial for Lambda.`).
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next step`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Configure settings` page, for :guilabel:`Environment type`, leave the default choice of
   :guilabel:`Create a new instance for environment (EC2)`.
#. For :guilabel:`Instance type`, leave the default choice of :guilabel:`t2.micro`. This choice has relatively low RAM and vCPUs, which is sufficient for this tutorial.

   .. note:: Choosing an instance type with greater compute resources might result in more charges to your AWS account.

#. For :guilabel:`Cost-saving setting`, leave the default choice of :guilabel:`After 30 minutes`. This is the amount of time until |AC9| shuts down the |EC2| instance for the
   |env|, after all web browser instances that are connected to the |IDE| for the |env| have been closed.

   .. note:: Choosing a longer time period might result in more charges to your AWS account.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Next step`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Review` page, choose :guilabel:`Create environment`. Wait while |AC9| creates
   your |env|. This can take a few minutes.

After |AC9| creates your |env|, it displays the |AC9IDE| for the |env|.

If |AC9| doesn't display the |IDE| after at least five minutes, there might be a problem with your web browser, your AWS access permissions, the instance, or the associated
virtual private cloud (VPC). For possible fixes, see 
:ref:`troubleshooting-env-loading` in *Troubleshooting*.

.. _tutorial-lambda-create-function:

Step 2: Create the |LAM| Function and API
=========================================

In this step, you use
the |AC9IDE| to create the |LAM| function and its accompanying API at the same time. |AC9| stores the new function on the |EC2| instance and deploys a
copy of the function to |LAM|. |AC9| also stores the new accompanying API on the instance and deploys a copy of the API to |ABP|.

The |LAM| function returns information about the day or time you specify, for example, the day, month, and year, or
the current hour, minute, and second.

Currently, you can use the |IDE| to automatically create functions that use only Node.js or Python. This function uses Node.js.

#. With the |IDE| open from the previous step, set the AWS Region that you want to create the function in. To do this, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. In the navigation pane of the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, choose :guilabel:`AWS Settings`.
#. For :guilabel:`AWS Region`, select the AWS Region you want to create the function in.

   .. image:: images/ide-prefs-aws-region.png
      :alt: AWS Region selector in the AWS Cloud9 IDE

#. On the edge of the |IDE|, choose :guilabel:`AWS Resources`.

   .. image:: images/ide-create-lambda-function.png
      :alt: Create a new Lambda function

#. Expand the :guilabel:`Lambda`, if it isn't already expanded. On the toolbar, choose the :guilabel:`Create a new Lambda function` icon.
#. In the :guilabel:`Create serverless application` dialog box, for :guilabel:`Function name`, type a name for the function (for
   example, :code:`myDateTimeFunction`).
#. For :guilabel:`Application name`, type a name for the function's containing serverless application (for example, :code:`MyDateTimeApplication`).
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. For :guilabel:`Select runtime`, choose :guilabel:`Node.js 6.10`.
#. For :guilabel:`Select blueprint`, choose :guilabel:`empty-nodejs`. This creates some starter code that you work with in the next step.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. For :guilabel:`Function trigger`, choose :guilabel:`API Gateway`. This creates an API in |ABP| that you use to run and debug the function in a later step.
#. For :guilabel:`Resource Path`, type :code:`/` (a forward slash). The :guilabel:`Resource Path` defines a portion of the URL that you use to run and debug the API in a later step. 
   For more information, see :ABP-dg:`Set up API Methods in API Gateway <how-to-method-settings>` in the |ABP-dg|.
#. For :guilabel:`Security`, choose :guilabel:`NONE`, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`. This specifies that you don't need any special credentials to run and debug this API.
#. For :guilabel:`Memory (MB)`, leave the default value of :guilabel:`128 MB`, which is sufficient for this tutorial.
#. For :guilabel:`Role`, leave the default value of :guilabel:`Automatically generate role`, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`. This specifies the access permissions that the function
   needs to work properly.
#. Review your choices, and then choose :guilabel:`Finish`.

|AC9| creates the function and its related API on the instance. Then it deploys a copy of the function and API to |LAM| and |ABP|.
The serverless application and function are displayed in the :guilabel:`Local Functions` and :guilabel:`Remote Functions` lists in the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window.
The serverless application's and function's component files are displayed in the :guilabel:`Environment` window. The editor opens the function's code file, :file:`index.js`.

.. image:: images/ide-new-lambda-function.png
   :alt: The new Lambda function in the IDE

.. note:: In addition to the function's code file, |AC9| creates the following helper files.

   * :file:`.application.json`: A hidden file that contains JSON-formatted settings that are specific to
     the serverless application. |AC9| uses these settings
     for its internal use. Do not edit this file.
   * :file:`.gitignore`: A hidden file that contains a list of files Git ignores, if you want to
     use Git to manage your source code for this function.
   * :file:`template.yaml`: An AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template file that contains information about the |LAM|
     function, the related API in |ABP|, and any other related, supported AWS resources. Whenever you update
     the local version of your function and then upload it to |LAM|, |AC9| calls AWS SAM to use this template file to do the upload.
     For more information, see :lambda-dev-guide:`Using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) <deploying-lambda-apps.html#serverless_app>` in the |LAM-dg|.

   The :file:`.application.json` and :file:`.gitignore` files are hidden. To show hidden files or hide
   them if they're shown, in the :guilabel:`Environment` window,
   choose the gear icon. Then choose :guilabel:`Show Hidden Files`.

   .. image:: images/console-lambda-files.png
      :alt: Showing the hidden Lambda files

.. _tutorial-lambda-add-code:

Step 3: Add Code to the Function
================================

In this step, you replace the starter code for the generated function with specific code that returns information about the day or time you specify.

With the :file:`index.js` file already open in the editor, completely replace the file's contents with the following code, and then save the file.

.. code-block:: javascript

   'use strict';

   exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {

     if (event.body) {
       event = JSON.parse(event.body);
     }

     var sc; // Status code
     var result = ""; // Response payload

     switch(event.option) {
       case "date":
         switch(event.period) {
           case "yesterday":
             result = setDateResult("yesterday");
             sc = 200;
             break;
           case "today":
             result = setDateResult();
             sc = 200;
             break;
           case "tomorrow":
             result = setDateResult("tomorrow");
             sc = 200;
             break;
           default:
             result = {
               "error": "Must specify 'yesterday', 'today', or 'tomorrow'."
             };
             sc = 400;
             break;
         }
         break;
         case "time":
           var d = new Date();
           var h = d.getHours();
           var mi = d.getMinutes();
           var s = d.getSeconds();

           result = {
             "hour": h,
             "minute": mi,
             "second": s
           };
           sc = 200;
           break;
         default:
           result = {
             "error": "Must specify 'date' or 'time'."
           };
           sc = 400;
         break;
     }

     const response = {
       statusCode: sc,
       headers: { "Content-type": "application/json" },
       body: JSON.stringify( result )
     };

     callback(null, response);

     function setDateResult(option) {

       var d = new Date(); // Today
       var mo; // Month
       var da; // Day
       var y; // Year

       switch(option) {
         case "yesterday":
           d.setDate(d.getDate() - 1);
           break;
         case "tomorrow":
           d.setDate(d.getDate() + 1);
         default:
          break;
       }

       mo = d.getMonth() + 1; // Months are zero offset (0-11)
       da = d.getDate();
       y = d.getFullYear();

       result = {
         "month": mo,
         "day": da,
         "year": y
       };

       return result;
     }
   };

This function takes an incoming payload with an :code:`option` value of :code:`date` or :code:`time`. If :code:`date` is specified, you must also specify a :code:`period` value of
:code:`yesterday`, :code:`today`, or :code:`tomorrow`. The function then returns the corresponding :code:`month`, :code:`day`, and :code:`year`. If, however,
an :code:`option` value of :code:`time` is specified, the function returns the current :code:`hour`, :code:`minute`, and :code:`second`.

.. _tutorial-lambda-run-local-function:

Step 4: Run the Function Locally
================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to run the function on the instance.
Currently, you can use the |IDE| to run functions that use only Node.js or Python.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   expand the :guilabel:`MyDateTimeApplication` Lambda folder, and then right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Local`.

   .. image:: images/ide-lambda-run-local.png
      :alt: Running the Lambda function locally

#. In the :guilabel:`Payload` pane of the run tab, replace :code:`{}` with the following, which sends this data as input to the function for processing.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "today"
      }

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. The :guilabel:`Response` pane displays the following.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "headers": {
          "Content-type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": "{\"month\":4,\"day\":12,\"year\":2018}"
      }

   .. note:: If the :guilabel:`Response` pane displays :code:`null`, be sure to save the :file:`index.js`, and then choose :guilabel:`Run` again.

   Compare your results to the following.

   .. image:: images/ide-run-lambda-local.png
      :alt: Running the Lambda function

#. Run the function several times with the following payloads to see what the :guilabel:`Response` pane displays.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "yesterday"
      }

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "tomorrow"
      }

      {
        "option": "time"
      }

      Displays an error. Must also specify a 'period' of 'yesterday', 'today', or 'tomorrow'.
      {
        "option": "date"
      }

      Displays an error. Must specify an 'option' of 'date' or 'time'.
      {
        "option": "dates"
      }

.. _tutorial-lambda-debug-local-function:

Step 5: Debug the Function Locally
==================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to debug the function on the instance. Currently, you can use the |IDE| to debug functions that use only Node.js or Python.
Also, you can use the |IDE| to debug functions locally only. You cannot use the |IDE| to debug functions in |LAM| itself.

#. In the :file:`index.js` file, create a breakpoint for the debugger. To do this, in the editor, next to the line of code
   :code:`callback(null, response)`, click the gutter just to the left of line 62. A red circle is displayed, representing the breakpoint.
#. On the right edge of the |IDE|, choose :guilabel:`Debugger`.
#. Add four expressions for the debugger to watch. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area,
   for :guilabel:`Type an expression here`, type :code:`event.option`, and then press :kbd:`Enter`.
   Do this three more times, typing :code:`event.period`, :code:`sc`, and :code:`response.body`.

   .. image:: images/ide-lambda-watch-expressions.png
      :alt: Adding watch expressions

#. On the run tab that |AC9| opened in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-function`, choose the icon that looks like a bug. (It switches from grey to green.)

   .. image:: images/debug-button.png
      :alt: The debug icon.

   .. image:: images/debug-icon-on.png
      :alt: Turning on debugging.

#. In the :guilabel:`Payload` pane on the run tab, be sure the following payload is still visible.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "today"
      }

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

   Code execution pauses at the breakpoint. The current values of :code:`event.option`, :code:`event.period`,
   :code:`sc`, and :code:`response.body` are displayed in the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area of the :guilabel:`Debugger` window.

   You can also see these values in the code by hovering your mouse over :code:`option` in line 12 in the code, :code:`period` in line 14,
   :code:`sc` in line 21, and :code:`response` in line 56. For :code:`response` in line 56, expand :guilabel:`Object {}`, and then see the :guilabel:`body` value.

   Compare your results to the following.

   .. image:: images/ide-lambda-debug-local.png
      :alt: Debugging the Lambda function

#. In the :code:`Debugger` window, choose the blue :guilabel:`Resume` arrow to finish running the code. (It looks like a triangular play button.)

.. _tutorial-lambda-run-local-api:

Step 6: Run the API Locally
===========================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to have |ABP| run the |LAM| function on the instance.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run APIGateway Local`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`Lambda (local)` list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing :guilabel:`API Gateway (local)`.

#. On the run tab, for :guilabel:`Path`, type :code:`/` (a forward slash).
#. For :guilabel:`Method`, choose :guilabel:`POST`.
#. For :guilabel:`Body`, replace :code:`{}` with the following, which sends this data as input to the API for processing.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "today"
      }

#. If the bug icon is green, choose it to turn it off. (It switches back to grey.)

   .. image:: images/debug-icon-off.png
      :alt: Turning off debugging
  
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. The :guilabel:`Response` pane displays the following response.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "month": 4,
        "day": 12,
        "year": 2018
      }

#. Run the function several times with the following payloads to see what the :guilabel:`Response` pane displays.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "yesterday"
      }

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "tomorrow"
      }

      {
        "option":"time"
      }

      Displays an error. Must also specify a 'period' of 'yesterday', 'today', or 'tomorrow'.
      {
        "option":"date"
      }

      Displays an error. Must specify an 'option' of 'date' or 'time'.
      {
        "option":"dates"
      }

Compare your results to the following.

.. image:: images/ide-api-run-local.png
   :alt: Running the API

.. _tutorial-lambda-debug-local-api:

Step 7: Debug the API Locally
=============================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to have |ABP| debug the |LAM| function on the instance.

#. Ensure that the :file:`index.js` file still has a breakpoint set on the line of code
   :code:`callback(null, response)`.
#. Ensure that the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area of the :guilabel:`Debugger` window is still watching
   :code:`event.option`, :code:`event.period`, :code:`sc`, and :code:`response.body`.
#. On the run tab from the previous step, choose the icon that looks like a bug. (It switches from grey to green.)
#. In the :guilabel:`Body` pane on the run tab, ensure the following is still visible.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "option": "date",
        "period": "today"
      }

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

   Code execution pauses at the breakpoint, and the current values of :code:`event.option`, :code:`event.period`,
   :code:`sc`, and :code:`response.body` are displayed in the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area of the :guilabel:`Debugger` window.

   You can also see these values in the code by hovering your mouse over :code:`option`, :code:`period`,
   :code:`sc`, and :code:`response` in the code. For :code:`response`, expand :guilabel:`Object {}`, and then see the :guilabel:`body` value.

#. In the :code:`Debugger` window, choose the blue :guilabel:`Resume` arrow to finish running the code.

.. _tutorial-lambda-run-deployed-function:

Step 8: Run the Function in Production
======================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to run the function in |LAM| itself.

|AC9| deployed the function to |LAM| during :ref:`tutorial-lambda-create-function`. However, |AC9| deployed the function before you made the changes in
:ref:`tutorial-lambda-add-code`. That original function was very basic, taking no payload and returning no response. So, you must first deploy your changes to |LAM|, and then
you can run the deployed function there.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window, expand :guilabel:`Local Functions`, expand the :guilabel:`MyDateTimeApplication` Lambda folder,
   right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Deploy`.
#. After the deployment finishes, right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Remote`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`API Gateway (local)` list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing :guilabel:`Lambda (remote)`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Payload` pane on the run tab, be sure one of the payloads from :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-function` is visible.
   If it isn't there, add it.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`, and see the results in the :guilabel:`Response` area. These should be the same results as in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-function`.

.. _tutorial-lambda-run-deployed-api:

Step 9: Run the API in Production
=================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to run the API in |ABP| itself.

.. note:: |AC9| deployed the API to |ABP| during :ref:`tutorial-lambda-create-function`. Because you haven't made any changes to the API since |AC9| first deployed it, you don't need to deploy
   the API again before you can run it in |ABP| itself.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run APIGateway Remote`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`Lambda (remote)` list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing :guilabel:`API Gateway (remote)`.

#. Ensure :guilabel:`Path` is still set to :guilabel:`/`, :guilabel:`Method` is still set to :guilabel:`POST`, and :guilabel:`Body` is still set to one of the
   bodies in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-api`. If any of these aren't set correctly, set them.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`, and see the results in the :guilabel:`Response` area, which should be the same results as in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-api`.

.. _tutorial-lambda-change-function:

Step 10: Change the Function Locally
====================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to make a small change to the |LAM| function. You then test the changed function locally and the original function in production to see
the differences.

#. In the :file:`index.js` file, on line 41, add a :code:`time` value to the :code:`result` variable, as follows.

   .. code:: javascript

      result = {
        "time": d.toTimeString(),
        "hour": h,
        "minute": mi,
        "second": s
      };

#. On line 86, add a :code:`date` value to the :code:`result` variable, as follows.

    .. code:: javascript

       result = {
         "date": d.toDateString(),
         "month": mo,
         "day": da,
         "year": y
       };

#. Save your changes to the :file:`index.js` file.
#. Run the changed function locally by following the instructions in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-local-function`. Notice that the :code:`time` or :code:`date` value is now displayed in the
   response.
#. Run the original function in production by following the instructions in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-deployed-function`. Notice that the :code:`time` or :code:`date` value doesn't display in the
   response yet. This is because you have not deployed the changed function into production. You do this in the next step.

.. _tutorial-lambda-deploy-function:

Step 11: Deploy the Changed Function into Production
====================================================

In this step, you deploy the changed function again to |LAM| itself. You then test the changed function in production to confirm the deployment.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window, right-click the :guilabel:`myDateTimeFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Deploy`.
#. After the deployment succeeds, run the changed function in production by following the instructions in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-run-deployed-function`.
   Notice that the :code:`time` or :code:`date` value now appears in the response.

Remember, whenever you make a change to the local function and you want to deploy those changes to |LAM| (and |ABP|, if an accompanying API exists), be sure to follow this step.

.. _tutorial-lambda-clean-up:

Step 12: Clean Up
=================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account that are related to this tutorial after you're finished, you can delete the function from |LAM|, the API from |ABP|, and the |env| from |AC9|.

Step 12.1: Delete the Function and the API from |LAM| and |ABP|
---------------------------------------------------------------

For |AC9| to create the function and its associated API, behind the scenes |AC9| uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to create a stack in |CFNlong|. This stack then creates the function and its associated API.
In this procedure, you use the |IDE| to have |CFN| delete the stack, which also deletes the function and the API. (You could use the |LAM| and |ABP| consoles instead of |CFN| to delete the function and its associated API.
However, that approach takes longer and still leaves the stack in |CFN| when it's no longer needed.)

.. warning:: Deleting a stack cannot be undone. When you delete this stack, the associated function and its API are deleted from |LAM| and |ABP| and cannot be recovered.

#. From the |IDE|, use the |clilong| (|cli|) in the terminal to run the |CFN| :code:`delete-stack` command, specifying the name and the AWS Region ID for the
   stack. (To display the terminal, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Window, New Terminal`). This stack's name follows the format :code:`cloud9-APPLICATION_NAME`, so you would specify :code:`cloud9-MyDateTimeApplication` for this tutorial.
   To get the AWS Region ID (represented in the following command as :code:`us-east-2`), see the corner of the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane in the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name cloud9-MyDateTimeApplication --region us-east-2

   If the command ran successfully, no output and no error message are displayed.

   .. note:: If you use an |IAM| user to run this command for this tutorial, instead of an AWS account root user or an |IAM| administrator,
      the |IAM| user must have the following additional AWS access permissions.

      * :code:`cloudformation:ListStacks`
      * :code:`cloudformation:DeleteStack`

      If you cannot add these permissions to the |IAM| user, see your organization's AWS account administrator.

#. To verify that the stack is deleted, use the |cli| to run the |CFN| :code:`describe-stacks` command. If the function is deleted, a message is displayed that the stack doesn't exist. (You might need to
   run this command multiple times until that message is displayed.)

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text --stack-name cloud9-MyDateTimeApplication --region us-east-2

#. If you no longer want to keep the local function in the |IDE|, delete the :file:`~/environment/MyDateTimeApplication` folder (for example, by running the command
   :code:`rm -rf ~/environment/MyDateTimeApplication`).

   .. note:: In the |IDE|, :file:`~/environment` is the same as specifying the root directory in the :guilabel:`Environment` window.

Step 12.2: Delete the |envtitle| from |AC9|
-------------------------------------------

.. warning:: Deleting an |env| cannot be undone. Also, when you delete an |envec2|, |AC9| also terminates the |EC2| instance that it previously launched and connected to the |env|.
   Once terminated in |EC2|, the instance cannot be reactivated or recovered.

#. From the |IDE|, open the dashboard in the |AC9| console. To do this, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Go To Your Dashboard`.
#. Do one of the following:

   * Choose the title inside of the :guilabel:`my-demo-lambda-environment` card, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.
   * Select the :guilabel:`my-demo-lambda-environment` card, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Delete` dialog box, type :kbd:`Delete`, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.
