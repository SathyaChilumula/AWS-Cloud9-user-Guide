Prerequisites
=============

.. include:: _sample-prereqs.txt

.. _sample-typescript-install:

Step 1: Install Required Tools
==============================

In this step, you install TypeScript by using Node Package Manager (:command:`npm`).
To install :command:`npm`, you use Node Version Manager (:command:`nvm`). If you don't have :command:`nvm`, you install it in this step first.

#. In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, confirm whether TypeScript is already installed by running the command line TypeScript
   compiler with the :command:`--version` option. (To start a new terminal session,
   on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If successful, the output contains the TypeScript version number.
   If TypeScript is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-typescript-code`.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tsc --version

#. Confirm whether :command:`npm` is already installed by running :command:`npm` with the :command:`--version` option. If successful, the output contains
   the :command:`npm` version number. If :command:`npm` is installed, skip ahead to step 10 in this procedure to use :command:`npm` to install TypeScript.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm --version

#. Run :code:`yum` to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update

#. To install :command:`npm`, begin by running the following command to download Node Version Manager (:command:`nvm`). (:command:`nvm` is a simple
   Bash shell script that's useful for installing and managing Node.js versions. For more information, see
   `Node Version Manager <https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md>`_ on the GitHub website.)

   .. code-block:: sh

      curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash

#. To start using :command:`nvm`, either close the terminal session and start it again, or source the :file:`~/.bashrc` file that contains the commands to load :command:`nvm`.

   .. code-block:: sh

      . ~/.bashrc

#. Confirm that :command:`nvm` is installed by running :command:`nvm` with the :command:`--version` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      nvm --version

#. Install the latest version of Node.js by running :command:`nvm`. (:command:`npm` is included in Node.js.)

   .. code-block:: sh

      nvm install node

#. Confirm that Node.js is installed by running the command line version of Node.js with the :command:`--version` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      node --version

#. Confirm that :command:`npm` is installed by running :command:`npm` with the :command:`--version` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm --version

#. Install TypeScript by running :command:`npm` with the :command:`-g` option. This installs TypeScript as a
   global package in the |env|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm install -g typescript

#. Confirm that TypeScript is installed by running the command line TypeScript
   compiler with the :command:`--version` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tsc --version

.. _sample-typescript-code:

Step 2: Add Code
================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, create a file named :file:`hello.ts`. 
   (To create a file, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`File, New File`. To save the file, choose :menuselection:`File, Save`.)
#. In a terminal in the |IDE|, from the same directory as the :file:`hello.ts` file, run :command:`npm` to install the
   :code:`@types/node` library.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm install @types/node

   This adds a 
   :file:`node_modules/@types/node` folder in the same directory as the :file:`hello.ts` file. This new folder
   contains Node.js type definitions that TypeScript needs later in this procedure for the :code:`console.log` and :code:`process.argv`
   properties that you will add to the :file:`hello.ts` file. 
#. Add the following code to the :file:`hello.ts` file:

   .. code-block:: typescript

      console.log('Hello, World!');

      console.log('The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.');

      const sum: number = parseInt(process.argv[2], 10) + parseInt(process.argv[3], 10);

      console.log('The sum of ' + process.argv[2] + ' and ' +
        process.argv[3] + ' is ' + sum + '.');

.. _sample-typescript-run:

Step 3: Run the Code
====================

#. In the terminal, from the same directory as the :file:`hello.ts` file, run the TypeScript compiler. Specify the
   :file:`hello.ts` file and additional libraries to include.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tsc hello.ts --lib es6

   TypeScript uses the :file:`hello.ts` file and
   a set of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) library files to transpile the TypeScript code in the
   :file:`hello.ts` file into equivalent JavaScript code in a file named :file:`hello.js`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Environment` window, open the :file:`hello.js` file.
#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Node.js`.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :kbd:`hello.js 5 9`. In the code, :code:`5` represents :code:`process.argv[2]`,
   and :code:`9` represents :code:`process.argv[3]`. (:code:`process.argv[0]` represents the name of the runtime (:code:`node`), and :code:`process.argv[1]` represents the name
   of the file (:file:`hello.js`).)
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`, and compare your output. When you're done, choose :guilabel:`Stop`.

   .. code-block:: text

      Hello, World!
      The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
      The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.

   :alt: Node.js output after running the code in the AWS Cloud9 IDE

.. note:: Instead of creating a new run configuration in the |IDE|, you can also execute this code by running the command
   :command:`node hello.js 5 9` from the terminal.

.. _sample-typescript-sdk:

Step 4: Install and Configure the |sdk-nodejs|
==============================================

You can enhance this sample to use the |sdk-nodejs| to create an |s3| bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install and configure the |sdk-nodejs|. The SDK provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as |s3|, from your JavaScript code.
After you install the |sdk-nodejs|, you must set up credentials management in your |env|. The SDK needs these credentials to interact with AWS services.

.. topic:: To install the |sdk-nodejs|

   In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, from the same directory as the :file:`hello.js` file from :ref:`sample-typescript-run`,
   run :command:`npm` to install the |sdk-nodejs|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm install aws-sdk

   This command adds several folders to the :file:`node_modules` folder from :ref:`sample-typescript-run`. These folders contain source code and
   dependencies for the |sdk-nodejs|.
   For more information, see :sdk-for-javascript-dev-guide-v2:`Installing the SDK for JavaScript <installing-jssdk.html>` in the
   |sdk-js-dg|.

.. topic:: To set up credentials management in your |env|

   Each time you use the |sdk-nodejs| to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the |sdk-nodejs| has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the
   credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call will fail.

   In this step, you store your credentials within the |env|. To do this, follow the instructions in :ref:`Call AWS Services from an Environment <credentials>`, and then return to this topic.

   For additional information, see :sdk-for-javascript-dev-guide-v2:`Setting Credentials in Node.js <setting-credentials-node.html>` in the
   |sdk-js-dg|.

.. _sample-typescript-sdk-code:

Step 5: Add AWS SDK Code
========================

In this step, you add some more code, this time to interact with |s3| to create a bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created. You'll
run this code later.

#. In the |AC9IDE|, in the same directory as the :file:`hello.js` file in previous steps, create a file named :file:`s3.ts`.
#. From a terminal in the |AC9IDE|, in the same directory as the :file:`s3.ts` file,
   enable the code to call |S3| operations asynchronously by running :command:`npm` twice to install the async library for TypeScript and again for JavaScript.

   .. code-block:: sh

      npm install @types/async # For TypeScript.
      npm install async        # For JavaScript.

#. Add the following code to the :file:`s3.ts` file:

   .. code-block:: typescript

      import * as async from 'async';
      import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';

      if (process.argv.length < 4) {
        console.log('Usage: node s3.js <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use>\n' +
          'Example: node s3.js my-test-bucket us-east-2');
        process.exit(1);
      }

      const AWS = require('aws-sdk'); // To set the AWS credentials and AWS Region.
      const async = require('async'); // To call AWS operations asynchronously.

      const s3: AWS.S3 = new AWS.S3({apiVersion: '2006-03-01'});
      const bucket_name: string = process.argv[2];
      const region: string = process.argv[3];

      AWS.config.update({
        region: region
      });

      const create_bucket_params: any = {
        Bucket: bucket_name,
        CreateBucketConfiguration: {
          LocationConstraint: region
        }
      };

      const delete_bucket_params: any = {
        Bucket: bucket_name
      };

      // List all of your available buckets in this AWS Region.
      function listMyBuckets(callback): void {
        s3.listBuckets(function(err, data) {
          if (err) {

          } else {
            console.log("My buckets now are:\n");

            for (let i: number = 0; i < data.Buckets.length; i++) {
              console.log(data.Buckets[i].Name);
            }
          }

          callback(err);
        });
      }

      // Create a bucket in this AWS Region.
      function createMyBucket(callback): void {
        console.log("\nCreating a bucket named '" + bucket_name + "'...\n");

        s3.createBucket(create_bucket_params, function(err, data) {
          if (err) {
            console.log(err.code + ": " + err.message);
          }

          callback(err);
        });
      }

      // Delete the bucket you just created.
      function deleteMyBucket(callback): void {
        console.log("\nDeleting the bucket named '" + bucket_name + "'...\n");

        s3.deleteBucket(delete_bucket_params, function(err, data) {
          if (err) {
            console.log(err.code + ": " + err.message);
          }

          callback(err);
        });
      }

      // Call the AWS operations in the following order.
      async.series([
        listMyBuckets,
        createMyBucket,
        listMyBuckets,
        deleteMyBucket,
        listMyBuckets
      ]);

.. _sample-typescript-sdk-run:

Step 6: Run the AWS SDK Code
============================

#. In the terminal, from the same directory as the :file:`s3.ts` file, run the TypeScript compiler. Specify the
   :file:`s3.ts` file and additional libraries to include.

   .. code-block:: sh

      tsc s3.ts --lib es6

   TypeScript uses the :file:`s3.ts` file, the |sdk-nodejs|, the async library, and
   a set of ECMAScript 6 (ES6) library files to transpile the TypeScript code in the
   :file:`s3.ts` file into equivalent JavaScript code in a file named :file:`s3.js`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Environment` window, open the :file:`s3.js` file.
#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Node.js`.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :samp:`s3.js {YOUR_BUCKET_NAME} {THE_AWS_REGION}`, where :samp:`{YOUR_BUCKET_NAME}` is the name of the bucket you want to create
   and then delete, and :samp:`{THE_AWS_REGION}` is the ID of the AWS Region to create the bucket in. For example, for the US East (Ohio) Region,
   use :code:`us-east-2`. For more IDs, see :aws-gen-ref:`Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <rande.html#s3_region>` in the |AWS-gr|.

   .. note:: |S3| bucket names must be unique across AWS |mdash| not just your AWS account.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`, and compare your output. When you're done, choose :guilabel:`Stop`.

   .. code-block:: text

      My buckets now are:

      Creating a new bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

      my-test-bucket

      Deleting the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

.. _sample-typescript-clean-up:

Step 7: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.
