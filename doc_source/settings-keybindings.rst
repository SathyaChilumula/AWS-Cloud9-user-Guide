    :description:
        Describes how to work with keybindings in the AWS Cloud9 IDE.

:dfn:`Keybindings` define your shortcut key combinations. Keybindings apply across each |envfirst| associated with your |IAM| user.
As you make changes to your keybindings, |AC9| pushes those changes to the cloud,
and associates them with your |IAM| user. |AC9| also continually scans the cloud for changes to keybindings
associated with your |IAM| user, and applies those changes
to your current |env|.

You can share your keybindings with other users.

.. _settings-keybindings-view:

View or Change Your Keybindings
===============================

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. To view your keybindings across each |env| of yours, on the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the
   side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Keybindings`.
#. To change your keybindings across each |env| of yours, in the :guilabel:`Keybindings` pane,
   change the settings you want.
#. To apply your changes to any |env|, simply open that |env|. If that |env| is
   already open, refresh the web browser tab for that |env|.

.. _settings-keybindings-share:

Share Your Keybindings with Another User
========================================

#. In both the source and target |env|, on the menu bar of the |AC9IDE|, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Open Your Keymap`.
#. In the source |env|, copy the contents of the :guilabel:`keybindings.settings` tab that is displayed.
#. In the target |env|, overwrite the contents of the :guilabel:`keybindings.settings` tab with the copied contents from the source |env|.
#. In the target |env|, save the :guilabel:`keybindings.settings` tab.

.. _settings-keybindings-mode:

Change Your Keyboard Mode
=========================

You can change the keyboard mode that the |AC9IDE| uses for interacting with text in the editor across
each |env| associated with your |IAM| user.

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Keybindings`.
#. For :guilabel:`Keyboard Mode`, choose one of these keyboard modes:

   * :guilabel:`Default` to use a set of default keybindings.
   * :guilabel:`Vim` to use Vim mode. For more information, see the `Vim help files <https://vimhelp.appspot.com/>`_ website.
   * :guilabel:`Emacs` to use Emacs mode. For more information, see `The Emacs Editor <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html>`_ on the GNU Operating System website.
   * :guilabel:`Sublime` to use Sublime mode. For more information, see the `Sublime Text Documentation <https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/>`_ website.

.. _settings-keybindings-os:

Change Your Operating System Keybindings
========================================

You can change the set of operating system keybindings the |AC9IDE| recognizes across each |env| associated with your |IAM| user.

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Keybindings`.
#. For :guilabel:`Operating System`, choose one of these operating systems:

   * :guilabel:`Auto` for the |AC9IDE| to attempt to detect which set of operating system keybindings to use.
   * :guilabel:`MacOS` for the |AC9IDE| to use the keybindings listed in Mac format.
   * :guilabel:`Windows / Linux` for the |AC9IDE| to use the keybindings listed in Windows and Linux formats.

.. _settings-keybindings-change:

Change Specific Keybindings
===========================

You can change individual keybindings across each |env| associated with your |IAM| user.

.. topic:: To change one keybinding at a time

   #. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Keybindings`.
   #. In the list of keybindings, double-click the keybinding in the :guilabel:`Keystroke` column you want to change.
   #. Use the keyboard to specify the replacement key combination, and then press :kbd:`Enter`.

      .. note:: To completely remove the current key combination, press :kbd:`Backspace` for Windows or Linux, or :kbd:`Delete` for Mac.

.. topic:: To change multiple keybindings at once

   #. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Open Your Keymap`.
   #. In the :file:`keybindings.settings` file, define each keybinding to be changed, for example:

      .. code-block:: json

         [
           {
             "command": "addfavorite",
             "keys": {
               "win": ["Ctrl-Alt-F"],
               "mac": ["Ctrl-Option-F"]
             }
           },
           {
             "command": "copyFilePath",
             "keys": {
               "win": ["Ctrl-Shift-F"],
               "mac": ["Alt-Shift-F"]
             }
           }
         ]

      In the example, :code:`addFavorite` and :code:`copyFilePath` are the names of keybindings
      in the :guilabel:`Keystroke` column in the :guilabel:`Keybindings` pane on the :guilabel:`Preferences`
      tab.
      The keybindings you want are :code:`win` and :code:`mac` for Windows
      or Linux and Mac, respectively.

      To apply your changes, save the :file:`keybindings.settings` file. Your changes should appear in the :guilabel:`Keybindings` pane after a short delay.

.. _settings-keybindings-reset:

Remove All of Your Custom Keybindings
=====================================

You can remove all custom keybindings and restore all keybindings to their default values, across each |env| associated with your |IAM| user.

.. caution:: You cannot undo this action.

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. On the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`Keybindings`.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Reset to Defaults`.
