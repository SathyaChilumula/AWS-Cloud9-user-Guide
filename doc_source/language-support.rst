The |AC9IDE| provides additional support for some programming languages, such as TypeScript, within the context of a language project. 
For more information, see :ref:`Working with Language Projects <projects>`.

**Notes**

:sup:`1` The |AC9IDE| provides syntax highlighting for many more languages. For a complete list, in the menu bar of the |IDE|, choose :guilabel:`View, Syntax`.

:sup:`2` You can run programs or scripts at the click of a button for languages marked with an **X**, without using the command line. For languages not marked with an **X** or
not displayed on the :guilabel:`Run, Run With` menu bar in the |IDE|,
you can create a runner for that language. For instructions, see :ref:`build-run-debug-create-builder-runner`.

:sup:`3` You can use the IDE's built-in tools to debug programs or scripts for languages marked with an **X**. For instructions, see :ref:`build-run-debug-debug`.

:sup:`4` This feature is in an experimental state for this language. It is not fully implemented and is not documented or supported.

:sup:`5` This feature supports only local functions for this language.

:sup:`6` This feature is not supported for Node.js versions 7.7.0 and later.

:sup:`7` To specify paths for |AC9| to use for completion of custom PHP code, in the |AC9IDE| turn on the :guilabel:`Project, PHP Support, Enable PHP code completion` setting 
in :guilabel:`Preferences`, and then add the paths to the custom code to the :guilabel:`Project, PHP Support, PHP Completion Include Paths` setting.

:sup:`8` To specify paths for |AC9| to use for completion of custom Python code, in the |AC9IDE| turn on the :guilabel:`Project, Python Support, Enable Python code completion` 
setting in :guilabel:`Preferences`, and then add the paths to the custom code to the :guilabel:`Project, Python Support, PYTHONPATH` setting.
