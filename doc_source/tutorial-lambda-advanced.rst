Advanced |LAMlong| Tutorial for |AC9long|
#########################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides an advanced hands-on tutorial that you can use to continue experimenting with AWS Lambda functions by using AWS Cloud9.

In this tutorial, you use the |AC9IDE| to create a function in |LAMlong| and an accompanying API in |ABPlong|. After you create the function and its API, you run and debug them locally.
Then you run the function and API in |LAM| and |ABP| in production. The function and its API call |SNSlong| (|SNS|) to send messages to an email address that you specify.

.. note:: Completing this tutorial might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for |EC2|, |LAM|, |ABP|, and |SNS|.
   For more information, see
   `Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_, `AWS Lambda Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/>`_,
   `Amazon API Gateway Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/>`_, and `Amazon SNS Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/sns/pricing/>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

Before you start this tutorial, we recommend that you first complete the companion :ref:`AWS Lambda Tutorial for AWS Cloud9 <tutorial-lambda>`. This tutorial
builds on the prerequisites and concepts that are presented there.

.. note:: If you don't want to complete that entire tutorial first, you must at least complete the following steps in that tutorial or else create the equivalent AWS resources.

   * :ref:`tutorial-lambda-prereqs`: This includes creating an AWS account if you don't already have one, and deciding which |IAM| entity in the account you'll use to complete this tutorial.
   * :ref:`tutorial-lambda-create-environment`: This includes creating an |envfirstlongec2| and opening the |AC9IDE| for that |env|.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-create-function:

Step 1: Create the |LAM| Function and API
=========================================

In this step, you use
the |AC9IDE| to create the |LAM| function and its accompanying API at the same time. |AC9| stores the new function on the |EC2| instance and deploys a
copy of the function to |LAM|. |AC9| also stores the new accompanying API on the instance and deploys a copy of the API to |ABP|.

The function uses |SNSlong| (|SNS|) to send messages to your email address.
In a later step, you create the |SNS| resources that this function needs.

Currently, you can use the |IDE| to create functions that use only Node.js or Python. This function uses Node.js.

#. With the |IDE| displayed for the |env|, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. In the navigation pane of the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, choose :guilabel:`AWS Settings`.
#. For :guilabel:`AWS Region`, select the AWS Region you want to create the function in.

   .. image:: images/ide-prefs-aws-region.png
      :alt: AWS Region selector in the AWS Cloud9 IDE

#. On the edge of the |IDE|, choose :guilabel:`AWS Resources`.
#. Expand the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane, if it's not already expanded. On the toolbar, choose :guilabel:`Create a new Lambda function`.

   .. image:: images/ide-create-lambda-function.png
      :alt: Create a new Lambda function

#. In the :guilabel:`Create serverless application` dialog box, for :guilabel:`Function name`, type a name for the function (for
   example, :code:`mySNSFunction`).
#. For :guilabel:`Application name`, type a name for the function's containing serverless application (for example, :code:`MySNSApplication`).
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. For :guilabel:`Select runtime`, choose :guilabel:`Node.js 6.10`.
#. For :guilabel:`Select blueprint`, choose :guilabel:`sns-send-message`. (You might need to scroll through the list of blueprints to see it.)
#. Choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. For :guilabel:`Function trigger`, choose :guilabel:`API Gateway`.
#. For :guilabel:`Resource Path`, type :code:`/`.
#. For :guilabel:`Security`, choose :guilabel:`NONE`, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`.
#. For :guilabel:`Memory (MB)`, leave the default value of :guilabel:`128 MB`, which is sufficient for this tutorial.
#. For :guilabel:`Role`, leave the default value of :guilabel:`Automatically generate role`, and then choose :guilabel:`Next`. (You change this role in the next step.)
#. Review your choices, and then choose :guilabel:`Finish`.

|AC9| creates the function and its related API on the instance and then deploys a copy of the function and API to |LAM| and |ABP|.
The serverless application and function are displayed in the :guilabel:`Local Functions` and :guilabel:`Remote Functions` lists in the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window.
The serverless application's and function's component files (for example, a |CFN| template that you use later to create |SNS| resources) are displayed in the :guilabel:`Environment` window.
The editor opens the function's code file, :file:`index.js`.

If you run this function or API now, it won't work. This is because the |SNS| resources that this function needs
are not set up yet. Also, the function doesn't have permission to call |SNS|. In the next step, you set up these resources and provide this permission.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-sns-setup:

Step 2: Set up |SNS|
====================

In this tutorial, the |LAM| function uses |SNS| to send messages to your email address.
In this step, you run an |CFNlong| stack that quickly creates a topic in |SNS| and then subscribes your email address to the topic. The stack also
creates an execution role in |IAM| to allow the |LAM| function
permission to use |SNS|. (You could do all of this setup in |SNS| and |IAM| manually, but |CFN| makes this setup easier and faster.)
After |CFN| creates the stack, you attach the execution role to the function, and then give |SNS| permission to start
sending messages to your email address.

#. In the terminal, change to the directory that contains the |CFN| template file named :file:`sns-create-topic-subscription.yaml`.

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd ~/environment/MySNSApplication

   .. note:: In the |IDE|, :file:`~/environment` is the same as specifying the root directory in the :code:`Environment` window.

#. Use the |cli| to run the following command, which creates and runs a |CFN| stack based on this template file.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation create-stack --template-body file://sns-create-topic-subscription.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameters ParameterKey=SNSTopicName,ParameterValue=MySNSTopic ParameterKey=EmailAddress,ParameterValue=me@example.com --stack-name MySNSStack --region us-east-2

   In the preceding command, do the following.

   * Replace :code:`MySNSTopic` with whatever you want to name the |SNS| topic to send messages to.
   * Replace :code:`me@example.com` with your email address for |SNS| to send messages to.
   * Replace :code:`MySNSStack` with whatever you want to name the stack.
   * Replace :code:`us-east-2` with the ID of the AWS Region where you created the function (see the corner of the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane in the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window).

   .. note:: If you use an |IAM| user to call |CFN| for this tutorial, instead of an AWS account root user or an |IAM| administrator
      user, the |IAM| user must have the following additional AWS access permissions.

      * :code:`cloudformation:CreateUploadBucket`
      * :code:`cloudformation:GetTemplateSummary`
      * :code:`cloudformation:ListStacks`
      * :code:`iam:CreateRole`
      * :code:`iam:PutRolePolicy`
      * :code:`sns:CreateTopic`
      * :code:`sns:GetTopicAttributes`
      * :code:`sns:Publish`
      * :code:`sns:SetTopicAttributes`
      * :code:`sns:Subscribe`

      If you cannot add these permissions to the |IAM| user, see your organization's AWS account administrator.

#. Confirm that |CFN| successfully created the stack. To do this, use the |cli| to run the following command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text --stack-name MySNSStack --region us-east-2

   Do not proceed until the |cli| outputs
   :code:`CREATE_COMPLETE`. (You might need to run this command multiple times before you see :code:`CREATE_COMPLETE`.)

#. In a few minutes, after |CFN| successfully creates the stack, check your inbox for an incoming email from :guilabel:`no-reply@sns.amazon.com`.
   In this email, choose the :guilabel:`Confirm subscription` link. A webpage then opens, confirming the subscription. Your email can't receive messages from this
   |SNS| topic until you confirm the subscription.
#. Change the function's settings to use the newly created execution role. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Environment` window,
   open the :file:`template.yaml` file in the :file:`~/environment/MySNSApplication` folder. In the editor,
   between the lines of code :code:`Properties` and :code:`Handler: mySNSFunction/index.handler`, add the following
   two lines of code to specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role for the function to use.

   .. code-block:: yaml

          Properties:
            Role:
              'Fn::Sub': 'arn:aws:iam::${AWS::AccountId}:role/LambdaSNSExecutionRole'
            Handler: mySNSFunction/index.handler

   .. note:: Because the :file:`template.yaml` file uses `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ syntax, spacing is important. Ensure that :code:`Role` is indented exactly **two** spaces from :code:`Properties`, and
      :code:`'Fn::Sub'` is indented exactly **two** spaces from :code:`Role`. Be sure to use spaces, and not tabs, to represent whitespace in this file.

#. In the same :file:`template.yaml` file, extend the function's default timeout period by changing the :code:`Timeout` value
   from :code:`15` to :code:`60`. Then save the file.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-run-local-function:

Step 3: Run the Function Locally
================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to run the newly created function on the instance, which sends messages to your email address.
Currently, you can use the |IDE| to run functions that use only Node.js or Python.

#. With the |IDE| still displayed for the |env|, in the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   expand :guilabel:`Local Functions`, expand the :guilabel:`MySNSApplication` Lambda folder, right-click the :guilabel:`mySNSFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Local`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Payload` pane on the run tab, replace the pane's contents with the following, which sends the specified data to the function for processing.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "region": "us-east-2",
        "message": "You just sent an email by using Amazon SNS.",
        "subject": "Hello from Amazon SNS",
        "topicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MySNSTopic"
      }

   In the preceding payload, do the following.

   * Replace :code:`us-east-2` with the ID of the AWS Region where the |SNS| topic exists.
   * Replace :code:`123456789012` with your AWS account ID.
   * Replace :code:`MySNSTopic` with the name of the |SNS| topic.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. If the response shows a :code:`statusCode` of :code:`200`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.

Compare your results to the following.

.. image:: images/ide-run-lambda.png
   :alt: Running the Lambda function

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-debug-local-function:

Step 4: Debug the Function Locally
==================================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to debug the function on the instance. Currently, you can use the |IDE| to debug functions that use only Node.js or Python.
Also, you can use the |IDE| to debug functions locally only. You cannot use the |IDE| to debug functions in |LAM| itself.

#. With the |IDE| still displayed for the |env|, open the :file:`index.js` file.
#. Create a breakpoint for the debugger. To do this, in the editor, click inside the gutter next to the line of code
   that starts with :code:`sns.publish` on line 45.
   A red circle is displayed, representing the breakpoint.
#. On the edge of the |IDE|, choose :guilabel:`Debugger`.
#. Add four expressions for the debugger to watch. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area,
   for :guilabel:`Type an expression here`, type :code:`event['subject']`, and then press :kbd:`Enter`.
   Do this two more times, typing :code:`context['memoryLimitInMB']` and :code:`sns.endpoint.hostname`.

   .. note:: If you completed the previous |LAM| tutorial, you can delete any of those watch expressions that might still be there. To do this, simply right-click
      an expression, and then choose :guilabel:`Remove Watch Expression`.

#. On the run tab from the previous step, choose the icon that looks like a bug. (It will switch from grey to green.)
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

   Code execution pauses at the breakpoint and displays the current values of the
   message's subject line, the function's memory limit in megabytes, and the |SNS| service's hostname.

   You can also see these values by hovering your mouse over :code:`event`, :code:`context`, and :code:`sns` 
   in the code, followed by expanding the screen tip that is displayed.

#. In the :code:`Debugger` window, choose the blue :guilabel:`Resume` button to finish running the code.
#. On the run tab, if the response shows a :code:`statusCode` of :code:`200`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-run-local-api:

Step 5: Run the API Locally
===========================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to have |ABP| run the |LAM| function on the instance.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   right-click the :guilabel:`mySNSFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run APIGateway Local`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`Lambda (local)` list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing :guilabel:`API Gateway (local)`.

#. On the run tab, for :guilabel:`Path`, type :code:`/`.
#. For :guilabel:`Method`, choose :guilabel:`POST`.
#. For :guilabel:`Body`, replace the pane's contents with the following, which sends this data as input to the API for processing.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "region": "us-east-2",
        "message": "You just sent an email by using Amazon SNS.",
        "subject": "Hello from Amazon SNS",
        "topicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyDemoSNSTopic"
      }

#. If the bug icon is green, choose it to turn it off. (It switches back to grey.)
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. If the response shows :code:`success`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.

.. note:: If the response is :code:`Missing required key 'Message' in params` instead of :code:`success`, then add the following code to your :file:`index.js` file, 
   save the file, and then try repeating this step again. 

   .. code-block:: javascript

      var sns = new AWS.SNS({apiVersion: '2010-03-31'});

      // Begin adding code here.
      if (event.body) {
        event = JSON.parse(event.body);
      }
      // End adding code here.

      var params ={
        Message: event['message'],
        Subject: event['subject'],
        TopicArn: event['topicARN']
      };

   For more information, see :ref:`lambda-functions-vs-api-gateway`.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-debug-local-api:

Step 6: Debug the API Locally
=============================

In this step, you use the |IDE| to have |ABP| debug the |LAM| function on the instance.

#. Ensure that the :file:`index.js` file still has a breakpoint set on the line of code
   :code:`sns.publish`.
#. Ensure that the :guilabel:`Watch Expressions` area of the :guilabel:`Debugger` window is still watching
   :code:`event['subject']`, :code:`context['memoryLimitInMB']`, and :code:`sns.endpoint.hostname`.
#. On the run tab from the previous step, choose the icon that looks like a bug. (It switches from grey to green.)
#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

   Code execution pauses at the breakpoint and displays the current values of the
   message's subject line, the function's memory limit in megabytes, the |SNS| service's hostname, and the caller's AWS access key ID.

   You can also see these values by hovering your mouse over :code:`event`, :code:`context`, and :code:`sns`
   followed by expanding the screen tip that is displayed.

#. In the :code:`Debugger` window, choose the blue :guilabel:`Resume` button to finish running the code.
#. If the response shows :code:`success`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-deploy-function:

Step 7: Deploy and Run the Changed Function in Production
=========================================================

In this step, you deploy the function that you changed in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-advanced-run-local-api` to |LAM| and |ABP|. You then test the changes in production to confirm the deployment.

#. In the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window, right-click the :guilabel:`mySNSFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Deploy`.
#. After the deployment succeeds, run the changed function in production. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   right-click the :guilabel:`mySNSFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Remote`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`API Gateway (local)` list on the run tab from the previous step, and then choosing :guilabel:`Lambda (remote)`.

#. Ensure that the :guilabel:`Payload` pane on the run tab still contains the following data.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "region": "us-east-2",
        "message": "You just sent an email by using Amazon SNS.",
        "subject": "Hello from Amazon SNS",
        "topicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyDemoSNSTopic"
      }

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. If the response shows a :code:`statusCode` of :code:`200`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.
#. Run the API in production. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Lambda` pane of the :guilabel:`AWS Resources` window,
   right-click the :guilabel:`mySNSFunction` Lambda icon, and then choose :guilabel:`Run, Run APIGateway Remote`.

   .. note:: You can also do this by choosing the :guilabel:`Lambda (remote)` list on the run tab, and then choosing :guilabel:`API Gateway (remote)`.

#. On the run tab, for :guilabel:`Path`, type :code:`/`.
#. For :guilabel:`Method`, choose :guilabel:`POST`.
#. For :guilabel:`Body`, be sure the following data is still displayed.

   .. code-block:: json

      {
        "region": "us-east-2",
        "message": "You just sent an email by using Amazon SNS.",
        "subject": "Hello from Amazon SNS",
        "topicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-2:123456789012:MyDemoSNSTopic"
      }

#. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.
#. If the response shows :code:`success`, then in a few minutes, check your email for the message that was sent.

.. _tutorial-lambda-advanced-clean-up:

Step 8: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account related to this tutorial, you can delete the function from |LAM|, the API from |ABP|, the topic and subscription from |SNS|,
the |LAM| execution role from |IAM|, and the |env| from |AC9|.

Step 8.1: Delete the Function and the API from |LAM| and |ABP|
--------------------------------------------------------------

For |AC9| to create the function and its associated API, behind the scenes |AC9| uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to create a stack in |CFNlong|. This stack then creates the function and its associated API.
In this procedure, you use the |IDE| to have |CFN| delete the stack, which also deletes the function and the API. (You could use the |LAM| and |ABP| consoles instead of |CFN| to delete the function and its associated API.
However, that approach takes longer and still leaves the stack in |CFN| when it's no longer needed.)

.. warning:: Deleting a stack cannot be undone. When you delete this stack, the associated function and its API are deleted from |LAM| and |ABP| and cannot be recovered.

#. From the |IDE|, use the |cli| in the terminal to run the |CFN| :code:`delete-stack` command, specifying the name of the
   stack. This stack's name follows the format :code:`cloud9-APPLICATION_NAME`, so you would specify :code:`cloud9-MySNSApplication` for this tutorial.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name cloud9-MySNSApplication --region us-east-2

   If the command ran successfully, no output and no error message are displayed.

   .. note:: If you use an |IAM| user to run this command for this tutorial, instead of an AWS account root user or an |IAM| administrator user,
      the |IAM| user must have the following additional AWS access permissions:

      * :code:`cloudformation:ListStacks`
      * :code:`cloudformation:DeleteStack`

      If you cannot add these permissions to the |IAM| user, see your organization's AWS account administrator.

#. To verify that the stack is deleted, use the |cli| to run the |CFN| :code:`describe-stacks` command. If the function is deleted, a message is displayed that the stack doesn't exist.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text --stack-name cloud9-MySNSApplication --region us-east-2

#. If you no longer want to keep the local function in the |IDE|, delete the :file:`~/environment/MySNSApplication` folder (for example, by running the command
   :code:`rm -rf ~/environment/MySNSApplication`).

Step 8.2: Delete the Topic and Subscription from |SNS| and the |LAM| Execution Role from |IAM|
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you delete the |CFN| stack that you created in :ref:`tutorial-lambda-advanced-sns-setup`, the |SNS| topic and subscription are deleted, as well as the execution role for the |LAM| function.

.. warning:: Deleting a stack cannot be undone. When you delete this stack, the associated topic, subscription, and execution role are deleted from |SNS| and |IAM| and cannot be recovered.

#. With the |IDE| still displayed for the |env|, use the |cli| in the terminal to run the |CFN| :code:`delete-stack` command, specifying the name of the stack.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name MySNSStack --region us-east-2

   .. note:: If you use an |IAM| user to run this command, instead of an AWS account root user or an |IAM| administrator
      user, the |IAM| user must have the following additional AWS access permissions.

      * :code:`cloudFormation:DeleteStack`
      * :code:`iam:DeleteRole`
      * :code:`iam:DeleteRolePolicy`
      * :code:`sns:DeleteTopic`
      * :code:`sns:Unsubscribe`

      If you cannot add these permissions to the |IAM| user, see your organization's AWS account administrator.

   If the command ran successfully, no output and no error message are displayed.

#. To verify that the stack is deleted, use the |cli| to run the following command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws cloudformation describe-stacks --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text --stack-name MySNSStack --region us-east-2

   Keep running the preceding command until the output states that the stack doesn't exist.

Step 8.3: Delete the |envtitle| from |AC9|
------------------------------------------

.. warning:: Deleting an |env| cannot be undone. Also, when you delete an |envec2|, |AC9| also terminates the |EC2| instance that it previously launched and connected to the |env|.
   Once terminated in |EC2|, the instance cannot be reactivated or recovered.

#. With the |IDE| still displayed for the |env|, open the dashboard in the |AC9| console. To do this, on the menu bar in the |IDE|, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Go To Your Dashboard`.
#. Do one of the following.

   * Choose the title that matches the name of the |env|, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.
   * Select the card that contains the name of the |env|, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.

#. In the :guilabel:`Delete` dialog box, type :kbd:`Delete`, and then choose :guilabel:`Delete`.
