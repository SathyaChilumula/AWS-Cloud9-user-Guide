        Describes how to work with image files in the AWS Cloud9 IDE. 

You can use the |AC9IDE| to view and edit image files.

* :ref:`images-view-edit`
* :ref:`images-resize`
* :ref:`images-crop`
* :ref:`images-rotate`
* :ref:`images-flip`
* :ref:`images-zoom`
* :ref:`images-smooth`

.. _images-view-edit:

View or Edit an Image
=====================

In the |AC9IDE|, open the file for the image you want to view or edit. Supported image file types include the following:

* :file:`.bmp`
* :file:`.gif` (view only)
* :file:`.ico` (view only)
* :file:`.jpeg`
* :file:`.jpg`
* :file:`.png`
* :file:`.tiff`

.. _images-resize:

Resize an Image
===============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. On the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`Resize`.
#. To change the image width, type a new :guilabel:`Width` in pixels. Or choose ":guilabel:`-`" or ":guilabel:`+`" next to :guilabel:`Width` to change the current width one pixel at a time.
#. To change the image height, type a new :guilabel:`Height` in pixels. Or choose ":guilabel:`-`" or
   ":guilabel:`+`" next to :guilabel:`Height` to change the current height one pixel at a time.
#. To maintain the image ratio of width to height, leave :guilabel:`Maintain Aspect Ratio` checked.
#. To confirm the image's new size, on the image editing bar, see the width (:guilabel:`W`) and height (:guilabel:`H`) measurements in pixels.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Resize`.
#. To discard the resizing, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Undo`. To keep the new
   size, choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _images-crop:

Crop an Image
=============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. Drag the mouse pointer over the portion of the image that you want to keep.
#. To confirm the selection's dimensions, on the image editing bar, see the :guilabel:`Selection` dimensions,
   as follows:

   * The distance in pixels from the original image's left edge to the left edge of the selection (:guilabel:`L`)
   * The distance in pixels from the original image's top edge to the top edge of the selection (:guilabel:`T`)
   * The selection's width in pixels (:guilabel:`W`)
   * The selection's height in pixels (:guilabel:`H`)

#. On the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`Crop`.
#. To discard the crop, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Undo`. To keep the new cropped image, choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _images-rotate:

Rotate an Image
===============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. To rotate the image counterclockwise, on the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`Rotate 90 Degrees Left`.
#. To rotate the image clockwise, on the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`Rotate 90 Degrees Right`.
#. To discard the rotation, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Undo`. To keep the new rotated image, choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _images-flip:

Flip an Image
=============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. To flip the image horizontally, on the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`FlipH`.
#. To flip the image vertically, on the image editing bar, choose :guilabel:`FlipV`.
#. To discard the flip, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Edit`, :guilabel:`Undo`. To keep the new flipped image, choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Save`.

.. _images-zoom:

Zoom an Image
=============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. On the image editing bar, choose one of the available zoom factors (for example, :guilabel:`75%`, :guilabel:`100%`, or :guilabel:`200%`).

.. _images-smooth:

Smooth an Image
===============

#. Open the image file in the IDE.
#. On the image editing bar, select :guilabel:`Smooth` to reduce the amount of pixelation in the image. To discard the smoothing, deselect :guilabel:`Smooth`.
#. On the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`File`, :guilabel:`Save`.
