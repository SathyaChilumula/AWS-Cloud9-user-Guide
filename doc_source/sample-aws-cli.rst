|clilong| and aws-shell Sample for |AC9long|
############################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides a hands-on sample that you can use to experiment with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and the aws-shell in AWS Cloud9.

This sample enables you to set up the |clilong| (|cli|), the aws-shell, or both in an |envfirst|. The |cli| and the aws-shell are unified tools that
provide a consistent interface for interacting with all parts of AWS. You can use the |cli| or the aws-shell instead of
the |console| to quickly run commands to interact with AWS, and some of these commands can only be run with the |cli| or the aws-shell.

For more information about the |cli|, see the |cli-ug|_. For the aws-shell, see the following resources:

* `aws-shell <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell>`_ on the GitHub website
* `aws-shell <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aws-shell>`_ on the pip website

For a list of commands you can run with the |cli| to interact with AWS, see the |cli-ref|_. You use the same commands with the aws-shell, except that 
you start commands without the :code:`aws` prefix.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as |EC2| and |S3|. For more information, see
`Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_ and `Amazon S3 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`_.

.. _sample-aws-cli-install:

Step 1: Install the |cli|, the aws-shell, or Both in Your |envtitle|
====================================================================

In this step, you use the |AC9IDE| to install the |cli|, the aws-shell, or both in your |env| so you can run commands to interact with AWS.

If you are using an |envfirstec2| and you only want to use the |cli|, you can skip ahead to :ref:`sample-aws-cli-run`. This is because the |cli| is already installed in an |envec2|, and a set of AWS access credentials is already set up in the |env|.
For more information, see :ref:`auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials`.

If you are not using an |envec2|, do the following to install the |cli|:

#. With your |env| open, in the |IDE|, check whether the |cli| is already installed. In the terminal, run the :command:`aws --version` command. (To start a new terminal session, on the
   menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If the |cli| is installed, the version number
   is displayed, with information such as the version numbers of Python and the operating system version number of your |EC2| instance or your own server.
   If the |cli| is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-aws-cli-creds`.
#. To install the |cli|, see :cli-ug:`Installing the AWS Command Line Interface <installing>` in the |cli-ug|. For example, for an |envec2| running Amazon Linux,
   run these three commands, one at a time, in the terminal to install the |cli|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update          # Install the latest system updates.
      sudo yum -y install aws-cli # Install the AWS CLI.
      aws --version               # Confirm the AWS CLI was installed.

Do the following to install the aws-shell:

#. With your |env| open, in the |IDE|, check whether the aws-shell is already installed. In the terminal, run the :command:`aws-shell --version` command. (To start a new terminal session, on the
   menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If the aws-shell is installed, the :code:`aws>` prompt is displayed. If the aws-shell is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-aws-cli-creds`.
#. To install the aws-shell, you use pip. To use pip, you must have Python installed. 

   To check whether Python is already installed (and to install it if needed), follow the instructions in :ref:`sample-python-install` in the *Python Sample*, and then return to this topic.
   
   To check whether pip is already installed, in the terminal, run the :command:`pip --version` command. If pip is installed, the version number is displayed. If pip is 
   not installed, install it. For example, for an |envec2| running Amazon Linux, run these three commands, one at a time, in the terminal to install pip.

   .. code-block:: sh

      wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py # Get the pip install file.
      sudo python get-pip.py                    # Install pip. (You might need to run 'sudo python2 get-pip.py' or 'sudo python3 get-pip.py' instead, depending on how Python is installed.)
      rm get-pip.py                             # Delete the pip install file, as it is no longer needed.

#. To use pip to install the aws-shell, run the following command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo pip install aws-shell

#. If the aws-shell is already installed, to upgrade to the latest version, run the following command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo pip install --upgrade aws-shell

.. _sample-aws-cli-creds:

Step 2: Set up Credentials Management in Your |envtitle|
========================================================

Each time you use the |cli| or the aws-shell to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the |cli| or the aws-shell has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the
credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call will fail.

If you are using an |envfirstec2|, you can skip ahead to :ref:`sample-aws-cli-run`. This is because credentials are already set up in an |envec2|. For more information, see :ref:`auth-and-access-control-temporary-managed-credentials`.

If you are not using an |envec2|, you must manually store your credentials within the |env|. To do this, follow the instructions in :doc:`credentials`, and then return to this topic.

.. _sample-aws-cli-run:

Step 3: Run Some Basic Commands with the |cli| or the aws-shell in Your |envtitle|
==================================================================================

In this step, you use the |cli| or the aws-shell in your |env| to create a bucket in |S3|, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket.

#. If you want to use the aws-shell but haven't started it yet, start the aws-shell by running the :code:`aws-shell` command. The :code:`aws>` prompt is displayed.
#. Create a bucket. Run the :command:`aws s3 mb` command with the |cli| or :command:`s3 mb` command with the aws-shell, supplying the name of the bucket to create. In this example, we use a bucket named
   :code:`cloud9-123456789012-bucket`, where :code:`123456789012` is your AWS account ID. If you use a different name, substitute it throughout this step.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws s3 mb s3://cloud9-123456789012-bucket # For the AWS CLI.
      s3 mb s3://cloud9-123456789012-bucket     # For the aws-shell.

   .. note:: Bucket names must be unique across all of AWS, not just your AWS account. The preceding
      suggested bucket name can help you come up with a unique bucket name.
      If you get a message that contains the error :code:`BucketAlreadyExists`, you must run the command again with a different bucket name.

#. List your available buckets. Run the :command:`aws s3 ls` command with the |cli| or the :command:`s3 ls` command with the aws-shell. A list of your available buckets is displayed.
#. Delete the bucket. Run the :command:`aws s3 rb` command with the |cli| or the :command:`s3 rb` command with the aws-shell, supplying the name of the bucket to delete.

   .. code-block:: sh

      aws s3 rb s3://cloud9-123456789012-bucket # For the AWS CLI.
      s3 rb s3://cloud9-123456789012-bucket     # For the aws-shell.

   To confirm whether the bucket was deleted, run the :command:`aws s3 ls` command again with the |cli| or the :command:`s3 ls` command again with the aws-shell. The name of 
   the bucket that was deleted should no longer appear in the list.

   .. note:: You don't have to delete the bucket if you want to keep using it. For more information,
      see :S3-gsg:`Add an Object to a Bucket <PuttingAnObjectInABucket>` in the |S3-gsg|.
      See also :cli-ref:`s3 commands <s3/rm.html>` in the |cli-ref|. (Remember, if you don't delete the
      bucket, it might result in ongoing charges to your AWS account.)

To continue experimenting with the |cli|, see :cli-ug:`Working with Amazon Web Services <chap-working-with-services>` in the |cli-ug| as well as the 
|cli-ref|_. To continue experimenting with the aws-shell, see the |cli-ref|_, noting that you start commands without the :code:`aws` prefix.

.. _sample-aws-cli-clean-up:

Step 4: Clean Up
================

If you're using the aws-shell, you can stop using it by running the :command:`.exit` or :command:`.quit` command.

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.
