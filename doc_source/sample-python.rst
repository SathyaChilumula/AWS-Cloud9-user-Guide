Prerequisites
=============

.. include:: _sample-prereqs.txt

.. _sample-python-install:

Step 1: Install Required Tools
==============================

In this step, you install Python, which is required to run this sample.

#. In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, confirm whether Python is already installed by running the :command:`python --version` command. (To start a new terminal session,
   on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If successful, the output contains
   the Python version number. If Python is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-python-code`.
#. Run the :command:`yum update` command to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update

#. Install Python by running one or more of these :command:`install` commands.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y install python27 # Installs Python 2.7.
      sudo yum -y install python36 # Installs Python 3.6.

   .. note:: If you have Python 2 and 3 installed, and you want to use Python 3 but running the :command:`python --version` command outputs a version of Python 2, you can
      use Python 3 in one or more of the following ways: 

      * Instead of using the built-in Python 2 runner in the |IDE|, use the built-in Python 3 runner. For more information, see :ref:`sample-python-run`.
      * Instead of running the :code:`python` command in a terminal session in the |IDE|, run the :code:`python3` command instead.
      * To set up the :code:`python` command to use Python 3, use a tool such as virtualenv to create a virtual environment for Python 3, 
        and then activate the new virtual environment. For example, you can run 
        commands similar to the following to create and then activate the virtual environment: 
        
        .. code-block:: sh

           virtualenv --version                  # If a version number is not output, see https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.
           which python                          # If the 'python' command is aliased to something like '/usr/bin/python27', prepare to unalias it.
           unalias python                        # If the 'python' command is aliased to something like '/usr/bin/python27', unalias it.
           python --version                      # Output the current Python version, for example 'Python 2.7.12'.
           python3 --version                     # Output the current version of Python 3, for example 'Python 3.6.2'.
           which python36                        # Output the path to the python36 binary, for example '/usr/bin/python36'.
           cd ~/environment/                     # Prepare to create a virtual environment in this path.
           virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python36 vpy36 # Create a virtual environment for Python 3.6 in this path.
           source vpy36/bin/activate             # Switch to use Python 3.6 instead of Python 2.7.12 when you run the 'python --version' command.
           python --version                      # Output the current Python version, for example 'Python 3.6.2'.
           deactivate                            # If and when you are done using Python 3.6, prepare to make Python 2.7.12 active again.
           alias python=/usr/bin/python27        # Switch back to outputting '/usr/bin/python27' when you run the 'which python' command.
        
        For more information, see `Installation <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_ and 
        `Usage <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/>`_ on the virtualenv website.

   For more information, see `Download Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ on the Python website and `Installing Packages <https://packaging.python.org/installing/>`_
   in the :title:`Python Packaging User Guide`.

.. _sample-python-code:

Step 2: Add Code
================

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`hello.py`.
(To create a file, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`File, New File`. To save the file, choose :menuselection:`File, Save`.)

.. code-block:: python

   import sys

   print('Hello, World!')

   print('The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.')

   sum = int(sys.argv[1]) + int(sys.argv[2])

   print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}.'.format(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sum))

.. note:: The preceding code doesn't rely on any custom Python modules or packages. However, if you ever import custom 
   Python modules or packages, and you want |AC9| to use 
   those modules or packages to do code completion as you type, 
   turn on the :guilabel:`Project, Python Support, Enable Python code completion` setting in :guilabel:`Preferences`, 
   and then add the paths to those modules or packages to the :guilabel:`Project, Python Support, PYTHONPATH` setting. 
   (To view and change your preferences, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences` on the menu bar.)

.. _sample-python-run:

Step 3: Run the Code
====================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Python 2` or :guilabel:`Python 3`, depending 
   on which version of Python you want to use.

   .. note:: If :guilabel:`Python 2` or :guilabel:`Python 3` isn't available, you can create a custom runner for the version of Python that is installed in 
      your |env|.

      #. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`New Runner`.
      #. On the :guilabel:`My Runner.run` tab, replace the tab's contents with this code.

         .. code-block:: json

            {
              "cmd" : ["python", "$file", "$args"],
              "info" : "Running $project_path$file_name...",
              "selector" : "source.py"
            }

      #. Choose :menuselection:`File, Save As` on the menu bar, and save the file as :file:`Python.run` in the :file:`/.c9/runners` folder.
      #. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Python`.
      #. Choose the :guilabel:`hello.py` tab to make it active.

      To use a specific version of Python that is installed in your |env|, change :code:`python` to the path to the Python executable in the preceding custom runner 
      definition (for example, :code:`/usr/bin/python27`, :code:`/usr/bin/python36`, or similar).

#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :kbd:`hello.py 5 9`. In the code, :code:`5` represents :code:`sys.argv[1]`,
   and :code:`9` represents :code:`sys.argv[2]`.
#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      Hello, World!
      The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
      The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.

.. _sample-python-sdk:

Step 4: Install and Configure the |sdk-python|
==================================================

You can enhance this sample to use the |sdk-python| to create an |s3| bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install and configure the |sdk-python|, which provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services, such as |s3|, from your Python code. Before you can install the
|sdk-python|, you must install pip. After you install the |sdk-python|, you must set up credentials management in your |env|. The
|sdk-python| needs these credentials to interact with AWS services.

.. topic:: To install pip

   #. In the |AC9IDE|, confirm whether pip is already installed by running the :command:`pip --version` command. If successful, the
      output contains the pip version number. Otherwise, an error message should be output. If pip is
      installed, skip ahead to the next procedure, "To install the |sdk-python|."
   #. To install pip, run these commands, one at a time.

      .. code-block:: sh

         curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py # Get the install script.
         sudo python get-pip.py                       # Install pip.
         rm get-pip.py                                # Delete the install script.

      For more information, see `pip Installation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ on the pip website.

.. topic:: To install the |sdk-python|

   After you install pip, use Python to run the :command:`pip install` command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo python -m pip install boto3

   For more information, see the "Installation" section of :sdk-python-dg:`Quickstart <quickstart>` in the |sdk-python-dg|.

.. topic:: To set up credentials management in your |env|

   Each time you use the |sdk-python| to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the |sdk-python| has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the
   credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call will fail.

   In this step, you store your credentials within the |env|. To do this, follow the instructions in :ref:`Call AWS Services from an Environment <credentials>`, and then return to this topic.

   For additional information, see :sdk-python-dg:`Credentials <configuration>` in the |sdk-python-dg|.

.. _sample-python-sdk-code:

Step 5: Add AWS SDK Code
========================

In this step, you add some more code, this time to interact with |s3| to create a bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created. You
will run this code later.

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`s3.py`.

.. code-block:: python

   import boto3
   import sys
   import botocore

   if len(sys.argv) < 3:
     print('Usage: python s3.py <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use>\n' + 
       'Example: python s3.py my-test-bucket us-east-2')
     sys.exit()

   bucket_name = sys.argv[1]
   region = sys.argv[2]

   s3 = boto3.client(
     's3',
     region_name = region
   )

   # Lists all of your available buckets in this AWS Region.
   def list_my_buckets(s3):
     resp = s3.list_buckets()

     print('My buckets now are:\n')

     for bucket in resp['Buckets']:
       print(bucket['Name'])

     return

   list_my_buckets(s3)

   # Create a new bucket.
   try:
     print("\nCreating a new bucket named '" + bucket_name + "'...\n")
     s3.create_bucket(Bucket = bucket_name,
       CreateBucketConfiguration = {
         'LocationConstraint': region
       }
     )
   except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
     if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'BucketAlreadyExists':
       print("Cannot create the bucket. A bucket with the name '" +
         bucket_name + "' already exists. Exiting.")
     sys.exit()

   list_my_buckets(s3)

   # Delete the bucket you just created.
   print("\nDeleting the bucket named '" + bucket_name + "'...\n")
   s3.delete_bucket(Bucket = bucket_name)

   list_my_buckets(s3)

.. _sample-python-sdk-run:

Step 6: Run the AWS SDK Code
============================

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Python 2` or :guilabel:`Python 3`, depending 
   on which version of Python you want to use and is installed in your |env|.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :code:`s3.py my-test-bucket us-east-2`, where :code:`my-test-bucket` is the name of the bucket you want to create 
   and then delete, and :code:`us-east-2` is the ID of the AWS Region you want to create the bucket in. 
   For more IDs, see :aws-gen-ref:`Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <rande.html#s3_region>` in the |AWS-gr|.

   .. note:: |S3| bucket names must be unique across AWS |mdash| not just your AWS account.

#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      My buckets now are:

      Creating a new bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

      my-test-bucket

      Deleting the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

.. _sample-python-clean-up:

Step 7: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.
