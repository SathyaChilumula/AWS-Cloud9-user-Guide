Moving or Resizing an Environment in |AC9long|

    :description:
        Describes how to move or resize an environment in AWS Cloud9.

You can move an |envfirst| from one |EC2| instance to another. (We also call this :dfn:`resizing` an |env|.) For example, you might want to do one of the following.

* Transfer an |env| from an |EC2| instance that is broken, or behaving in unexpected ways, to a healthy instance.
* Transfer an |env| from an older instance to an instance that has the latest system updates.
* Increase an instance's compute resources, because the |env| is over-utilized on the current instance.
* Decrease an instance's compute resources, because the |env| is under-utilized on the current instance.

.. note:: Before you resize an |env|, you might want to try stopping some running processes in the |env| or adding a 
   swap file to the |env|. For more information, see :ref:`troubleshooting_ide_low_memory` in *Troubleshooting*.

   This topic only covers resizing an |env| from one |EC2| instance to another.
   To resize an |env| from one of your own servers to another, refer to your server's documentation.

   You cannot resize an |env| to an |EC2| instance of the same type. When you resize, you must choose a different |EC2| instance type for the new instance.

Before you start the resize process, note the following. 

* You must stop the |EC2| instance that is associated with an |env| before you can change the instance type. While the instance is stopped, neither you nor any 
  members will be able to use the |env| that are associated with the stopped instance.
* We move the instance to new hardware; however, the instance's ID does not change.
* If the instance is running in an |VPC| and has a public IPv4 address, we release the address and give it a new public IPv4 address. 
  The instance retains its private IPv4 addresses, any Elastic IP addresses, and any IPv6 addresses.
* Ensure that you plan for downtime while your instance is stopped. The process might take several minutes.

To resize an |env|, do the following. 

#. (Optional) If the new instance type requires drivers that are not installed on the existing instance, you must connect to your instance and install the drivers first. 
   For more information, see :ec2-user-guide:`Compatibility for Resizing Instances <ec2-instance-resize.html#resize-limitations>` in the |EC2-ug|.
#. Close all web browser tabs that are currently displaying the |env|.

   .. important:: If you do not close all of the web browser tabs that are currently displaying the |env|, |AC9| might interfere with allowing you to fully complete the procedure. 
      Specifically, |AC9| might try at the wrong time during this procedure to restart the |EC2| instance that is associated with the |env|. The instance must stay stopped until the 
      very last step in this procedure.

#. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, if you are not already signed in, at https://console.aws.amazon.com.

   We recommend you sign in using credentials for an |IAM| administrator user in your AWS account. If you cannot
   do this, check with your AWS account administrator.

#. Open the |EC2| console. To do this, in the :guilabel:`Services` list, choose :guilabel:`EC2`.
#. In the AWS navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that contains the |env| that you want to resize (for example, :guilabel:`US East (Ohio)`).
#. In the service navigation pane, expand :guilabel:`Instances` if it is not already expanded, and then choose :guilabel:`Instances`.
#. In the list of instances, choose the instance that is associated with the |env| that you want to resize. For an |envec2|, 
   the instance name starts with :code:`aws-cloud9-` followed by the |env| name. For example,
   if the |env| is named :code:`my-demo-environment`,
   the instance name will start with :code:`aws-cloud9-my-demo-environment`.
#. If the :guilabel:`Instance State` is not :guilabel:`stopped`, choose :guilabel:`Actions, Instance State, Stop`. When prompted, choose :guilabel:`Yes, Stop`. 
   It can take a few minutes for the instance to stop.
#. After the :guilabel:`Instance State` is :guilabel:`stopped`, with the instance still selected, 
   choose :guilabel:`Actions, Instance Settings, Change Instance Type`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Change Instance Type` dialog box, for :guilabel:`Instance Type`, choose the new instance type that you want the |env| to use. 

   .. note:: If the instance type that you want does not appear in the list, then it is not compatible with the instance's configuration (for example, because of its virtualization type).

#. (Optional) If the instance type that you chose supports EBS–optimization, select :guilabel:`EBS-optimized` to enable EBS–optimization, or clear :guilabel:`EBS-optimized` 
   to disable EBS–optimization.
   
   .. note:: If the instance type that you chose is EBS–optimized by default, :guilabel:`EBS-optimized` is selected and you can't clear it.

#. Choose :guilabel:`Apply` to accept the new settings. 

   .. note:: If you did not choose a different instance type for :guilabel:`Instance Type` earlier in this procedure, nothing happens after you choose :guilabel:`Apply`.

#. Reopen the |env|. For more information, see :ref:`Opening an Environment <open-environment>`.

For more information about the preceding procedure, see :ec2-user-guide:`Changing the Instance Type <ec2-instance-resize.html>` in the |EC2-ug|.
