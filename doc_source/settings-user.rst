Working with User Settings in the |AC9IDElongtitle|
###################################################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Describes how to work with user settings in the AWS Cloud9 IDE.

:dfn:`User settings`, which apply across each |envfirst| associated with your |IAM| user, include the following kinds of settings:

* General user interface behaviors, such as whether to enable animations
* File system navigation behaviors
* File find and search behaviors
* Color schemes for terminal sessions and output
* Additional code editor behaviors, such as code folding, full line selection, scrolling animations, and font sizes

As you make changes to your user settings, |AC9| pushes those changes to the cloud and
associates them with your |IAM| user. |AC9| also continually scans the cloud for changes to user settings
associated with your |IAM| user, and applies those settings
to your current |env|.

You can share your user settings with other users.

* :ref:`settings-user-share`
* :ref:`settings-user-change`

.. _settings-user-view:

View or Change Your User Settings
=================================

#. On the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences`.
#. To view your user settings across each |env| of yours, on the :guilabel:`Preferences` tab, in the side navigation pane, choose :guilabel:`User Settings`.
#. To change your user settings across each |env| of yours, in the :guilabel:`User Settings` pane, change
   the settings you want.
#. To apply your changes to any other |env| of yours, simply open that |env|. If that |env| is
   already open, refresh the web browser tab for that |env|.

For more information, see :ref:`settings-user-change`.

.. _settings-user-share:

Share Your User Settings with Another User
==========================================

#. In both the source and target |env|, on the menu bar of the |AC9IDE|, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Open Your User Settings`.
#. In the source |env|, copy the contents of the :guilabel:`user.settings` tab that is displayed.
#. In the target |env|, overwrite the contents of the :guilabel:`user.settings` tab with the copied contents from the source |env|.
#. In the target |env|, save the :guilabel:`user.settings` tab.
