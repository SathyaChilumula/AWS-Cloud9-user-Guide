PHP Sample for |AC9long|
########################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides a hands-on sample that you can use to experiment with PHP in AWS Cloud9.

This sample enables you to run some PHP scripts in an |envfirst|.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as |EC2| and |S3|. For more information, see
`Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_ and `Amazon S3 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

.. include:: _sample-prereqs.txt

.. _sample-php-install:

Step 1: Install Required Tools
==============================

In this step, you install PHP, which is required to run this sample.

.. note:: The following procedure installs PHP only. To install related tools such as an Apache web server and a MySQL database, see
   :ec2-ug:`Tutorial: Installing a LAMP Web Server on Amazon Linux <install-LAMP>` in the |ec2-ug|.

#. In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, confirm whether PHP is already installed by running the :command:`php --version` command. (To start a new terminal session,
   on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If successful, the output contains
   the PHP version number. If PHP is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-php-code`.
#. Run the :command:`yum update` command to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update

#. Install PHP by running the :command:`install` command.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y install php56

   For more information, see `Installation and Configuration <http://php.net/manual/en/install.php>`_ on the PHP website.

.. _sample-php-code:

Step 2: Add Code
================

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`hello.php`.
(To create a file, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`File, New File`. To save the file, choose :menuselection:`File, Save`, type :code:`hello.php` for :guilabel:`Filename`, and then choose :guilabel:`Save`.)

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
     print('Hello, World!');

     print("\nThe sum of 2 and 3 is 5.");

     $sum = (int)$argv[1] + (int)$argv[2];

     print("\nThe sum of $argv[1] and $argv[2] is $sum.");
   ?>

.. note:: The preceding code doesn't rely on any external files. However, if you ever include or require other PHP files in your file, and you want |AC9| to use 
   those files to do code completion as you type, 
   turn on the :guilabel:`Project, PHP Support, Enable PHP code completion` setting in :guilabel:`Preferences`, 
   and then add the paths to those files to the :guilabel:`Project, PHP Support, PHP Completion Include Paths` setting. 
   (To view and change your preferences, choose :guilabel:`AWS Cloud9, Preferences` on the menu bar.)

.. _sample-php-run:

Step 3: Run the Code
====================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`PHP (cli)`.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :samp:`hello.php 5 9`. In the code, :code:`5` represents :code:`$argv[1]`,
   and :code:`9` represents :code:`$argv[2]`. (:code:`$argv[0]` represents the name of the file (:file:`hello.php`).)
#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      Hello, World!
      The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
      The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.

.. _sample-php-sdk:

Step 4: Install and Configure the |sdk-php|
===========================================

You can enhance this sample to use the |sdk-php| to create an |s3| bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install and configure the |sdk-php|, which provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as |s3|, from your PHP code.
Before you can install the |sdk-php|, you should install `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_. After you install the |sdk-php|, you must set up credentials management in your |env|.
The |sdk-php| needs these credentials to interact with AWS services.

.. topic:: To install Composer

   Run the :command:`curl` command with the silent (:code:`-s`) and show error (:code:`-S`) options, piping the Composer installer into a PHP archive (PHAR) file,
   named :file:`composer.phar` by convention.

   .. code-block:: sh

      curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

.. topic:: To install the |sdk-php|

   Use the php command to run the Composer installer to install the |sdk-php|.

   .. code-block:: sh

      php composer.phar require aws/aws-sdk-php

   This command creates several folders and files in your |env|. The primary file you will use is :file:`autoload.php`, which is in the :file:`vendor` folder in your |env|.

   For more information, see :sdk-php-gsg-v3:`Installation <installation>` in the |sdk-php-gsg|.

.. topic:: To set up credentials management in your |env|

   Each time you use the |sdk-php| to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the |sdk-php| has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the
   credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call will fail.

   In this step, you store your credentials within the |env|. To do this, follow the instructions in :ref:`Call AWS Services from an Environment <credentials>`, and then return to this topic.

   For additional information, see the "Creating a client" section of :sdk-php-gsg-v3:`Basic Usage <basic-usage>` in the |sdk-php-gsg|.

.. _sample-php-sdk-code:

Step 5: Add AWS SDK Code
========================

In this step, you add some more code, this time to interact with |s3| to create a bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created. You
will run this code later.

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`s3.php`.

.. code-block:: php

   <?php
     require './vendor/autoload.php';

     if ($argc < 4) {
       exit("Usage: php s3.php <the time zone> <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use>\n" .
         "Example: php s3.php America/Los_Angeles my-test-bucket us-east-2");
     }
     
     $timeZone = $argv[1];
     $bucketName = $argv[2];
     $region = $argv[3];
     
     date_default_timezone_set($timeZone);

     $s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
       'region' => $region,
       'version' => '2006-03-01'
     ]);

     # Lists all of your available buckets in this AWS Region.
     function listMyBuckets($s3) {
       print("\nMy buckets now are:\n");

       $promise = $s3->listBucketsAsync();

       $result = $promise->wait();

       foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket) {
         print("\n");
         print($bucket['Name']);
       }
     }

     listMyBuckets($s3);

     # Create a new bucket.
     print("\n\nCreating a new bucket named '$bucketName'...\n");

     try {
       $promise = $s3->createBucketAsync([
         'Bucket' => $bucketName,
         'CreateBucketConfiguration' => [
           'LocationConstraint' => $region
         ]
       ]);

       $promise->wait();

     } catch (Exception $e) {
       if ($e->getCode() == 'BucketAlreadyExists') {
         exit("\nCannot create the bucket. " .
           "A bucket with the name '$bucketName' already exists. Exiting.");
       }
     }

     listMyBuckets($s3);

     # Delete the bucket you just created.
     print("\n\nDeleting the bucket named '$bucketName'...\n");

     $promise = $s3->deleteBucketAsync([
       'Bucket' => $bucketName
     ]);

     $promise->wait();

     listMyBuckets($s3);
   ?>

.. _sample-php-sdk-run:

Step 6: Run the AWS SDK Code
============================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`PHP (cli)`.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :code:`s3.php America/Los_Angeles my-test-bucket us-east-2`, where:

   * :code:`America/Los_Angeles` is your default time zone ID. For more IDs, see `List of Supported Timezones <http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php>`_ on the PHP website.
   * :code:`my-test-bucket` is the name of the bucket you want to create and then delete.

     .. note:: |S3| bucket names must be unique across AWS |mdash| not just your AWS account.

   * :code:`us-east-2` is the ID of the AWS Region you want to create the bucket in. 
     For more IDs, see :aws-gen-ref:`Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <rande.html#s3_region>` in the |AWS-gr|. 

#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      My buckets now are:

      Creating a new bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

      my-test-bucket

      Deleting the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

.. _sample-php-clean-up:

Step 7: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.
