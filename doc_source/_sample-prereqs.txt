Before you use this sample, be sure to meet the following requirements.

* **You must have an existing AWS Cloud9 development environment.** This sample assumes you already have an |envfirstec2| that is connected to an |EC2| instance running Amazon Linux. 
  If you have a different type of |env| or 
  operating system, you might need to adapt this sample's instructions to set up related tools. See :ref:`Creating an Environment <create-environment>` for details.
* **You have the AWS Cloud IDE for the existing environment already open.** When you open an |env|, |AC9| opens the |IDE| for that |env| in your web browser. 
  See :ref:`Opening an Environment <open-environment>` for details.
