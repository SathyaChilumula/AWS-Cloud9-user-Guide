Go Sample for |AC9long|
#######################

.. meta::
    :description:
        Provides a hands-on sample that you can use to experiment with Go in AWS Cloud9.

This sample enables you to run some Go code in an |envfirst|.

Creating this sample might result in charges to your AWS account. These include possible charges for services such as |EC2| and |S3|. For more information, see
`Amazon EC2 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/>`_ and `Amazon S3 Pricing <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/>`_.

Prerequisites
=============

.. include:: _sample-prereqs.txt

.. _sample-go-install:

Step 1: Install Required Tools
==============================

In this step, you install and configure Go, which is required to run this sample.

#. In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, confirm whether Go is already installed by running the :command:`go version` command. (To start a new terminal session,
   on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Window, New Terminal`.) If successful, the output should contain the Go version number. Otherwise, an error message should be output.
   If Go is installed, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-go-code`.
#. Run the :command:`yum update` command to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update

#. To install Go, run these commands, one at a time.

   .. code-block:: sh

      wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz # Download the Go installer.
      sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf ./go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz              # Install Go.
      rm ./go1.9.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz                                       # Delete the installer.

   The preceding commands assume the latest stable version of Go at the time this topic was written. 
   For more information, see `Downloads <https://golang.org/dl/>`_ on The Go Programming Language website.
#. Add the path to the Go binary to your :code:`PATH` environment variable, like this.

   #. Open your shell profile file (for example, :file:`~/.bashrc` in Amazon Linux) for editing.
   #. At the end of this line of code, type the following, so that the code now looks like this.

      .. code-block:: sh

         PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

    #. Save the file.

#. Source the :file:`~/.bashrc` file so that the terminal can now find the Go binary you just referenced.

   .. code-block:: sh

      . ~/.bashrc

#. Confirm that Go is now successfully installed and configured by running the :command:`go version` command. If successful, the output contains the Go version number.

.. _sample-go-code:

Step 2: Add Code
================

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`hello.go`.
(To create a file, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`File, New File`. To save the file, choose :menuselection:`File, Save`.)

.. code-block:: go

   package main

   import (
     "fmt"
     "os"
     "strconv"
   )

   func main() {
     fmt.Printf("Hello, World!\n")

     fmt.Printf("The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.\n")

     first, _ := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
     second, _ := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[2])
     sum := first + second

     fmt.Printf("The sum of %s and %s is %s.",
       os.Args[1], os.Args[2], strconv.Itoa(sum))
   }

.. _sample-go-run:

Step 3: Run the Code
====================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Go`.

   .. note:: If :guilabel:`Go` is not available, you can create a custom runner for Go.

      #. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`New Runner`.
      #. On the :guilabel:`My Runner.run` tab, replace the tab's contents with this code.

         .. code-block:: json

            {
              "cmd" : ["go", "run", "$file", "$args"],
              "info" : "Running $project_path$file_name...",
              "selector" : "source.go"
            }

      #. Choose :menuselection:`File, Save As` on the menu bar, and save the file as :file:`Go.run` in the :file:`/.c9/runners` folder.
      #. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Go`.
      #. Choose the :guilabel:`hello.go` tab to make it active.

#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :samp:`hello.go 5 9`. In the code, :code:`5` represents :code:`os.Args[1]`,
   and :code:`9` represents :code:`os.Args[2]`.

   .. image:: images/ide-go-simple.png
      :alt: Output of running the Go code in the AWS Cloud9 IDE


#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      Hello, World!
      The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
      The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.

.. _sample-go-sdk:

Step 4: Install and Configure the |sdk-go|
==========================================

You can enhance this sample to use the |sdk-go| to create an |s3| bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this step, you install and configure the |sdk-go|, which provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as |s3|, from your Go code.
Before you install the |sdk-go|, you must set your :code:`GOPATH` environment variable. After you install the |sdk-go| and set your :code:`GOPATH` environment variable,
you must set up credentials management in your |env|. The |sdk-go| needs these credentials to interact with AWS services.

.. topic:: To set your GOPATH environment variable

   #. Open your :file:`~/.bashrc` file for editing.
   #. After the last line in the file, type this code.

      .. code-block:: sh

         GOPATH=~/environment/go

         export GOPATH

   #. Save the file.
   #. Source the :file:`~/.bashrc` file so that the terminal can now find the :code:`GOPATH` environment variable you just referenced.

      .. code-block:: sh

         . ~/.bashrc

   #. Confirm that the :code:`GOPATH` environment variable is successfully set by running the :command:`echo
      $GOPATH` command. If successful, :code:`/home/ec2-user/environment/go` should be output.

.. topic:: To install the |sdk-go|

   Run the :command:`go get` command, specifying the location of the |sdk-go| source.

   .. code-block:: sh

      go get -u github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/...

   Go installs the |sdk-go| source into the location specified by your :code:`GOPATH` environment variable, which is the :file:`go` folder in your |env|.

.. topic:: To set up credentials management in your |env|

   Each time you use the |sdk-go| to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the
   |sdk-go| has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the credentials don't cover the appropriate
   permissions, the call will fail.

   In this step, you store your credentials within the |env|. To do this, follow the instructions in :ref:`Call AWS Services from an Environment <credentials>`, and then return to this topic.

   For additional information, see :sdk-for-go-dev-guide-v1:`Specifying Credentials <configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials>` in the
   |sdk-go-dg|.

.. _sample-go-sdk-code:

Step 5: Add AWS SDK Code
========================

In this step, you add some more code, this time to interact with |s3| to create a bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created. You
will run this code later.

In the |AC9IDE|, create a file with this content, and save the file with the name :file:`s3.go`.

.. code-block:: go

   package main

   import (
     "fmt"
     "os"
     "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
     "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session"
     "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3"
   )

   func main() {

     if len(os.Args) < 3 {
       fmt.Printf("Usage: go run s3.go <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use>\n" +
         "Example: go run s3.go my-test-bucket us-east-2\n")
       os.Exit(1)
     }

     sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{
       SharedConfigState: session.SharedConfigEnable,
     }))
     svc := s3.New(sess, &aws.Config{
       Region: aws.String(os.Args[2]),
     })

     listMyBuckets(svc)
     createMyBucket(svc, os.Args[1], os.Args[2])
     listMyBuckets(svc)
     deleteMyBucket(svc, os.Args[1])
     listMyBuckets(svc)
   }

   // List all of your available buckets in this AWS Region.
   func listMyBuckets(svc *s3.S3) {
     result, err := svc.ListBuckets(nil)

     if err != nil {
       exitErrorf("Unable to list buckets, %v", err)
     }

     fmt.Println("My buckets now are:\n")

     for _, b := range result.Buckets {
       fmt.Printf(aws.StringValue(b.Name) + "\n")
     }

     fmt.Printf("\n")
   }

   // Create a bucket in this AWS Region.
   func createMyBucket(svc *s3.S3, bucketName string, region string) {
     fmt.Printf("\nCreating a new bucket named '" + bucketName + "'...\n\n")

     _, err := svc.CreateBucket(&s3.CreateBucketInput{
      Bucket: aws.String(bucketName),
      CreateBucketConfiguration: &s3.CreateBucketConfiguration{
        LocationConstraint: aws.String(region),
      },
    })

     if err != nil {
       exitErrorf("Unable to create bucket, %v", err)
     }
   }

   // Delete the bucket you just created.
   func deleteMyBucket(svc *s3.S3, bucketName string) {
     fmt.Printf("\nDeleting the bucket named '" + bucketName + "'...\n\n")

     _, err := svc.DeleteBucket(&s3.DeleteBucketInput{
       Bucket: aws.String(bucketName),
     })

     if err != nil {
       exitErrorf("Unable to delete bucket, %v", err)
     }
   }

   // If there's an error, display it.
   func exitErrorf(msg string, args ...interface{}) {
     fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, msg+"\n", args...)
     os.Exit(1)
   }

.. _sample-go-sdk-run:

Step 6: Run the AWS SDK Code
============================

#. In the |AC9IDE|, on the menu bar, choose :menuselection:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
#. On the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`Go`.
#. For :guilabel:`Command`, type :samp:`s3.go {YOUR_BUCKET_NAME} {THE_AWS_REGION}`, where :samp:`{YOUR_BUCKET_NAME}` is the name of the bucket you want to create 
   and then delete, and :samp:`{THE_AWS_REGION}` is the ID of the AWS Region you want to create the bucket in. For example, for the US East (Ohio) Region, 
   use :code:`us-east-2`. For more IDs, see :aws-gen-ref:`Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) <rande.html#s3_region>` in the |AWS-gr|.

   .. note:: |S3| bucket names must be unique across AWS |mdash| not just your AWS account.

#. Choose the :guilabel:`Run` button, and compare your output.

   .. code-block:: text

      My buckets now are:

      Creating a new bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

      my-test-bucket

      Deleting the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...

      My buckets now are:

.. _sample-go-clean-up:

Step 7: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.
