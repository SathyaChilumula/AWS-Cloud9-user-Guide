Prerequisites
=============

.. include:: _sample-prereqs.txt

.. _sample-dotnetcore-setup:

Step 1: Install Required Tools
==============================

In this step, you install the .NET Core 2 SDK into your |env|, which is required to run this sample.

#. Confirm whether the .NET Core 2 SDK is already installed in your |env|. To do this, in a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, run the .NET Core command line interface (CLI)
   with the :command:`-help` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      dotnet -help

   If the .NET Command Line Tools version is displayed, and the version is 2.0 or greater, skip ahead to :ref:`sample-dotnetcore-app`. If the version is less than 2.0, or if
   an error such as :code:`bash: dotnet: command not found` is displayed, continue on to install the .NET Core 2 SDK.

#. In a terminal session in the |AC9IDE|, run the following commands to help ensure the latest security updates and bug fixes are installed,
   and to install a :code:`libunwind` package that the .NET Core 2 SDK needs. (To start a new terminal session, on the menu bar,
   choose :guilabel:`Window, New Terminal`.)

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum -y update
      sudo yum -y install libunwind

#. Get the URL for the .NET Core 2 SDK file to download into your |env|. To get this URL, do the following from a web browser on your local computer (not from the |IDE|):

   #. Go to `.NET downloads <https://www.microsoft.com/net/download>`_ on the Microsoft website.
   #. On the :guilabel:`.NET downloads` page, choose the :guilabel:`Linux` tab. In the :guilabel:`.NET Core` section, under :guilabel:`Other Linux downloads`, choose the link 
      next to :guilabel:`Binaries` in the :guilabel:`Build apps - SDK` column that starts with :guilabel:`x64`.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Thanks for downloading .NET Core SDK` page, if a download dialog box appears, close it or choose :guilabel:`Cancel`.
      (Do not download the .NET Core 2 SDK file to your local computer.)
   #. Right-click the :guilabel:`Try again` link, and choose the command that copies the download URL to your system clipboard.
      For example, the download URL might be as follows.

      .. code-block:: sh

         https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/8/A/E8AF2EE0-5DDA-4420-A395-D1A50EEFD83E/dotnet-sdk-2.1.401-linux-x64.tar.gz

#. Back in the |IDE|, download the .NET Core 2 SDK file into your |env|. To do this, run the :command:`wget` command in the terminal with the download URL you copied earlier.

   .. code-block:: sh

      wget https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/8/A/E8AF2EE0-5DDA-4420-A395-D1A50EEFD83E/dotnet-sdk-2.1.401-linux-x64.tar.gz

#. Extract the .NET Core 2 SDK download file into a subdirectory named :file:`dotnet` within the home directory of your |env|. To do this, run the :command:`mkdir` command with the
   path to the new :file:`dotnet` subdirectory to create. Then run the :command:`tar` command with the name and location of the .NET Core 2 SDK file to extract along with
   the path to the :file:`dotnet` subdirectory.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir -p $HOME/dotnet
      tar zxf dotnet-sdk-2.1.401-linux-x64.tar.gz -C $HOME/dotnet

   For the :command:`mkdir` command, :code:`-p` creates intermediate directories as needed. The :command:`tar` command uses the following options. 
   
   * :code:`z` specifies to extract a file of type :file:`tar.gz`.
   * :code:`x` extracts the file.
   * :code:`f` specifies the name and location of the file to extract.
   * :code:`-C` extracts the file to the specified location.

#. In the :file:`.bash_profile` file for the |env|, add the :file:`$HOME/dotnet` subdirectory to the :code:`PATH` variable for the |env|, as follows.

   #. Open the :file:`.bash_profile` file for editing by using the :command:`vi` command.

      .. code-block:: sh

         vi ~/.bash_profile

   #. Using the down arrow or :kbd:`j` key, move to the line that starts with :code:`PATH`.
   #. Using the right arrow or :kbd:`$` key, move to the end of that line.
   #. Switch to insert mode by pressing the :kbd:`i` key. (:code:`-- INSERT ---` will appear at the end of the display.)
   #. Add the :file:`~/dotnet` subdirectory to the :command:`PATH` variable by typing :code:`:$HOME/dotnet`. Be sure to include the colon character (:code:`:`). The line should
      now look similar to the following.

      .. code-block:: sh

         PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$HOME/dotnet

   #. Save the file. To do this, press the :kbd:`Esc` key (:code:`-- INSERT ---` will disappear from the end of the display),
      type :code:`:wq` (to write to and then quit the file), and then press :kbd:`Enter`.

#. Load the .NET Core 2 SDK by sourcing the :file:`.bash_profile` file.

   .. code-block:: sh

      . ~/.bash_profile

#. Confirm the .NET Core 2 SDK is loaded by running .NET Core CLI with the :command:`--help` option.

   .. code-block:: sh

      dotnet --help

   If successful, the .NET Core 2 SDK version number is displayed, with additional usage information.

#. If you no longer want to keep the .NET Core 2 SDK file in your |env|, you can delete it as follows.

   .. code-block:: sh

      rm dotnet-sdk-2.1.200-linux-x64.tar.gz

.. _sample-dotnetcore-app:

Step 2: Create a .NET Core Console Application Project
======================================================

In this step, you use .NET Core to create a project named :code:`hello`. This project contains all of the files that .NET Core needs to run a simple application from the terminal in the |IDE|. The
application's code is written in C#.

#. In the terminal, run the following commands to create a directory for the project, and then switch to that new directory.

   .. code-block:: sh

      mkdir hello
      cd hello

#. Create a .NET Core console application project. To do this, run the .NET Core CLI with the :command:`new` command, specifying the console application project template type and the
   programming language to use (in this sample, C#).

   .. code-block:: sh

      dotnet new console -lang C#

   The preceding command adds a subdirectory named :file:`obj` with several files, and some additional standalone files, to the :file:`hello` directory. You should note the following two key files:

   * The :file:`hello/hello.csproj` file contains information about the console application project.
   * The :file:`hello/Program.cs` file contains the application's code to run.

.. _sample-dotnetcore-code:

Step 3: Add Code
================

In this step, you add some code to the application.

From the :guilabel:`Environment` window in the |AC9IDE|, open the :file:`hello/Program.cs` file.

In the editor, replace the file's current contents with the following code, and
then save the :file:`Program.cs` file.

.. code-block:: csharp

   using System;

   namespace hello
   {
     class Program
     {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
         Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

         Console.WriteLine("The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.");

         int sum = Int32.Parse(args[0]) + Int32.Parse(args[1]);

         Console.WriteLine("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}.",
           args[0], args[1], sum.ToString());
       }
     }
   }

.. _sample-dotnetcore-run:

Step 4: Build and Run the Code
==============================

In this step, you build the project and its dependencies into a set of binary files, including a runnable application file. Then you run the application.

#. In the |IDE|, create a builder for .NET Core as follows.

   #. On the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Run, Build System, New Build System`.
   #. On the :guilabel:`My Builder.build` tab, replace the tab's contents with the following code.

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "cmd" : ["dotnet", "build"],
           "info" : "Building..."
         }

   #. Choose :guilabel:`File, Save As`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Filename`, type :code:`.NET Core.build`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Folder`, type :code:`/.c9/builders`.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Save`.

#. With the contents of the :file:`Program.cs` file displayed in the editor, choose :guilabel:`Run, Build System, .NET Core`. Then choose :guilabel:`Run, Build`.

   This builder adds a subdirectory named :file:`bin` and adds a subdirectory named :file:`Debug` to the :file:`hello/obj` subdirectory. Note the following three key
   files.

   * The :file:`hello/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/hello.dll` file is the runnable application file.
   * The :file:`hello/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/hello.deps.json` file lists the application's dependencies.
   * The :file:`hello/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/hello.runtimeconfig.json` file specifies the shared runtime and its version for the application.

#. Create a runner for .NET Core as follows.

   #. On the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Run, Run With, New Runner`.
   #. On the :guilabel:`My Runner.run` tab, replace the tab's contents with the following code.

      .. code-block:: json

         {
           "cmd" : ["dotnet", "run", "$args"],
           "working_dir": "$file",
           "info" : "Running..."
         }

   #. Choose :guilabel:`File, Save As`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Filename`, type :code:`.NET Core.run`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Folder`, type :code:`/.c9/runners`.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Save`.

#. Run the application with two integers to add (for example, :code:`5` and :code:`9`) as follows.

   #. With the contents of the :file:`Program.cs` file displayed in the editor, choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
   #. In the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`.NET Core`.
   #. In the :guilabel:`Command` box, type :code:`hello 5 9`.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

      By default, this runner instructs .NET Core to run the :file:`hello.dll` file in the :file:`hello/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0` directory.

      Compare your output to the following.

      .. code-block:: text

         Hello, World!
         The sum of 2 and 3 is 5.
         The sum of 5 and 9 is 14.

.. _sample-dotnetcore-sdk:

Step 5: Create and Set Up a .NET Core Console Application Project That Uses the |sdk-net|
=========================================================================================

You can enhance this sample to use the |sdk-net| to create an |s3| bucket, list your available buckets, and then delete the bucket you just created.

In this new project, you add a reference to the |sdk-net|. The |sdk-net| provides a convenient way to interact with AWS services such as |s3|,
from your .NET code. You then set up AWS credentials management in your |env|. The |sdk-net| needs these credentials to interact with AWS services.

.. topic:: To create the project

   #. In the terminal, run the following commands to change to the root directory of the |env|, create a directory for a project named :code:`s3`, and then switch to that new directory.

      .. code-block:: sh

         cd ..
         mkdir s3
         cd s3

   #. Create a .NET Core console application project. To do this, run the .NET Core CLI with the :command:`new` command, specifying the console application project template type and the
      programming language to use.

      .. code-block:: sh

         dotnet new console -lang C#

   #. Add a project reference to the |S3| package in the |sdk-net|. To do this, run the .NET Core CLI with the :command:`add package` command, specifying the name of the |S3| package in NuGet.
      (NuGet defines how packages for .NET are created, hosted, and consumed, and provides the tools for each of those roles.)

      .. code-block:: sh

         dotnet add package AWSSDK.S3

      When you add a project reference to the |S3| package, NuGet also adds a project reference to the rest of the |sdk-net|.

      .. note:: For the names and versions of other AWS related packages in NuGet, see `NuGet packages tagged with aws-sdk <https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22aws-sdk%22>`_ on the NuGet website.

.. topic:: To set up AWS credentials management

   Each time you use the |sdk-net| to call an AWS service, you must provide a set of AWS credentials with the call. These credentials determine whether the
   |sdk-net| has the appropriate permissions to make that call. If the credentials don't cover the appropriate permissions, the call will fail.

   To store your credentials within the |env|, follow the instructions in :ref:`Call AWS Services from an Environment <credentials>`, and then return to this topic.

   For additional information, see :sdk-net-dg:`Configuring AWS Credentials <net-dg-config-creds>` in the |sdk-net-dg|.

.. _sample-dotnetcore-sdk-code:

Step 6: Add AWS SDK Code
========================

In this step, you add code to interact with |S3| to create a bucket, delete the bucket you just created, and then list your available buckets.

From the :guilabel:`Environment` window in the |AC9IDE|, open the :file:`s3/Program.cs` file. In the editor, replace the file's current contents with the following code, and
then save the :file:`Program.cs` file.

.. code-block:: csharp

   using Amazon;
   using Amazon.S3;
   using Amazon.S3.Model;
   using Amazon.S3.Util;
   using System;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;

   namespace s3
   {
     class Program
     {
       private static RegionEndpoint bucketRegion;
       private static IAmazonS3 s3Client;

       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
         if (args.Length < 2) {
           Console.Write("Usage: <the bucket name> <the AWS Region to use>\n" +
             "Example: my-test-bucket us-east-2\n");
           return;
         }

         if (args[1] == "us-east-2") {
           bucketRegion = RegionEndpoint.USEast2;
         } else {
           Console.WriteLine("Cannot continue. The only supported AWS Region ID is " +
             "'us-east-2'.");
           return;
         }
         // Note: You could add more valid AWS Regions above as needed.

         s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(bucketRegion);
         var bucketName = args[0];

         // Create the bucket.
         try
         {
           if (DoesBucketExist(bucketName))
           {
             Console.WriteLine("Cannot continue. Cannot create bucket. \n" +
               "A bucket named '{0}' already exists.", bucketName);
             return;
           } else {
             Console.WriteLine("\nCreating the bucket named '{0}'...", bucketName);
             s3Client.PutBucketAsync(bucketName).Wait();
           }
         }
         catch (AmazonS3Exception e)
         {
           Console.WriteLine("Cannot continue. {0}", e.Message);
         }
         catch (Exception e)
         {
           Console.WriteLine("Cannot continue. {0}", e.Message);
         }

         // Confirm that the bucket was created.
         if (DoesBucketExist(bucketName))
         {
           Console.WriteLine("Created the bucket named '{0}'.", bucketName);
         } else {
           Console.WriteLine("Did not create the bucket named '{0}'.", bucketName);
         }

         // Delete the bucket.
         Console.WriteLine("\nDeleting the bucket named '{0}'...", bucketName);
         s3Client.DeleteBucketAsync(bucketName).Wait();

         // Confirm that the bucket was deleted.
         if (DoesBucketExist(bucketName))
         {
           Console.WriteLine("Did not delete the bucket named '{0}'.", bucketName);
         } else {
           Console.WriteLine("Deleted the bucket named '{0}'.", bucketName);
         };

         // List current buckets.
         Console.WriteLine("\nMy buckets now are:");
         var response = s3Client.ListBucketsAsync().Result;

         foreach (var bucket in response.Buckets)
         {
           Console.WriteLine(bucket.BucketName);
         }
       }

       static bool DoesBucketExist(string bucketName)
       {
         if ((AmazonS3Util.DoesS3BucketExistAsync(s3Client, bucketName).Result))
         {
           return true;
         } else {
           return false;
         }
       }
     }
   }

.. _sample-dotnetcore-sdk-run:

Step 7: Build and Run the AWS SDK Code
======================================

In this step, you build the project and its dependencies into a set of binary files, including a runnable application file. Then you run the application.

#. Build the project. To do this, with the contents of the :file:`s3/Program.cs` file displayed in the editor, on the menu bar, choose :guilabel:`Run, Build`.
#. Run the application with the name of the |S3| bucket to create and the ID of the AWS Region to
   create the bucket in (for example, :code:`my-test-bucket` and :code:`us-east-2`) as follows.

   #. With the contents of the :file:`s3/Program.cs` file still displayed in the editor, choose :guilabel:`Run, Run Configurations, New Run Configuration`.
   #. In the :guilabel:`[New] - Idle` tab, choose :guilabel:`Runner: Auto`, and then choose :guilabel:`.NET Core`.
   #. In the :guilabel:`Command` box, type the name of the application, the name of the |S3| bucket to create, and the ID of the AWS Region to
      create the bucket in (for example, :code:`s3 my-test-bucket us-east-2`).
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Run`.

      By default, this runner instructs .NET Core to run the :file:`s3.dll` file in the :file:`s3/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0` directory.

      Compare your results to the following output.

      .. code-block:: text

         Creating a new bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...
         Created the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'.

         Deleting the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'...
         Deleted the bucket named 'my-test-bucket'.

         My buckets now are:

.. _sample-dotnetcore-clean-up:

Step 8: Clean Up
================

To prevent ongoing charges to your AWS account after you're done using this sample, you should delete the |env|.
For instructions, see :doc:`Delete an Environment <delete-environment>`.
