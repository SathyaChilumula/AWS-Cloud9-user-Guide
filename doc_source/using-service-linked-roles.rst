        How to use service-linked roles to give AWS Cloud9 access to resources in your AWS account.

|SERVICENAMElong| uses |IAMlong| (|IAM|) :IAM-ug:`service-linked roles <id_roles_terms-and-concepts>`.
A service-linked role is a unique type of |IAM| role that is linked directly to |SERVICENAME|. Service-linked roles are predefined by
|SERVICENAME| and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.

A service-linked role makes setting up |SERVICENAME| easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions.
|SERVICENAME| defines the permissions of its service-linked roles, and only |SERVICENAME| can assume its roles.
The defined permissions include the trust policy and the permissions policy, and that permissions policy cannot be attached to any other
|IAM| entity.

You can delete the roles only after first deleting their related resources. This protects
your |SERVICENAME| resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources.

For information about other services that support service-linked roles,
see :IAM-ug:`AWS Services That Work with IAM <reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam>` and look for the services that have **Yes** in the
**Service-Linked Role** column. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service-linked role documentation for that service.

Service-Linked Role Permissions for |SERVICENAME|
=================================================

|SERVICENAME| uses the service-linked role named |SLR-NAME|.
This service-linked role trusts the service :code:`cloud9.amazonaws.com` to assume the role.

The role permissions policy allows |SERVICENAME| to complete the following actions on the
specified resources.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "cloudformation:CreateStack",
           "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
           "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
           "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
           "ec2:DescribeVpcs",
           "ec2:RunInstances"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
           "ec2:DeleteSecurityGroup",
           "ec2:TerminateInstances"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "cloudformation:DeleteStack"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/aws-cloud9-*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:CreateTags"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
         "Condition": {
           "StringLike": {
             "aws:RequestTag/Name": "aws-cloud9-*"
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "ec2:StartInstances"
         ],
         "Resource": "*",
         "Condition": {
           "StringLike": {
             "ec2:ResourceTag/aws:cloudformation:stack-name": "aws-cloud9-*"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }

You must configure permissions to allow |AC9| 
to create a service-linked role on behalf of an |IAM| entity (such as a user, group, or role).

To allow |AC9|
to create the |SLR-NAME| service-linked role, add the following statement to the
permissions policy for the |IAM| entity on whose behalf |AC9| needs to create the service-linked role.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
     ],
     "Resource": "*",
     "Condition": {
       "StringLike": {
         "iam:AWSServiceName": "cloud9.amazonaws.com"
       }
     }
   }

Alternatively, you can add the AWS managed policies :code:`AWSCloud9User` or :code:`AWSCloud9Administrator` to the |IAM| entity.

To allow an |IAM| entity to delete the |SLR-NAME| service-linked role, add the
following statement to the permissions policy for the |IAM| entity that needs to
delete a service-linked role.

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole",
       "iam:GetServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus"
     ],
     "Resource": "*",
     "Condition": {
       "StringLike": {
         "iam:AWSServiceName": "cloud9.amazonaws.com"
       }
     }
   }

.. _create-service-linked-role:

Creating a Service-Linked Role for |SERVICENAME|
================================================

You don't need to manually create a service-linked role. When you |INTRO-ACTION-IN-SERVICE|, |SERVICENAME| creates the service-linked role for you.

.. _edit-service-linked-role:

Editing a Service-Linked Role for |SERVICENAME|
===============================================

|SERVICENAME| doesn't allow you to edit the |SLR-NAME| service-linked role. For example, after you
create a service-linked role, you can't change the name of the role because various entities
might reference the role. However, you can edit the description of the role using |IAM|. For 
more information, see :iam-user-guide:`Editing a Service-Linked Role <using-service-linked-roles.html#edit-service-linked-role>` in the |IAM-ug|.

.. _delete-service-linked-role:

Deleting a Service-Linked Role for |SERVICENAME|
================================================

If you no longer need to use a feature or service that requires a service-linked role, we 
recommend that you delete that role. That way you don’t have an unused entity that is not 
actively monitored or maintained.

.. _delete-service-linked-role-service-console:

Deleting a Service-Linked Role in |IAM|
---------------------------------------

Before you can use |IAM| to delete a service-linked role, you must remove any |SERVICENAME| resources used by the role.
To remove |SERVICENAME| resources, see :ref:`Deleting an Environment <delete-environment>`.

You can use the |IAM| console to delete the |SLR-NAME| service-linked 
role. For more information, see :iam-user-guide:`Deleting a Service-Linked Role <using-service-linked-roles.html#delete-service-linked-role>` in the |IAM-ug|.

.. _slr-regions:

Supported Regions for |SERVICENAME| Service-Linked Roles
========================================================

|SERVICENAME| supports using service-linked roles in in all of the regions where the service is available. 
For more information, see :aws-gen-ref:`AWS Cloud9 <rande.html#cloud9_region>` in the |AWS-gr|.
