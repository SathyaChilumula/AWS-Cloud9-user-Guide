    :description:
        Describes Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) requirements for use by certain AWS Cloud9 development environments in an AWS account.

Every |envfirstlong| associated with an |VPClong| (|VPC|) must meet specific 
VPC requirements. These |envplural| include |envec2plural|, as well as |envsshplural| associated with AWS cloud compute instances (for example |EC2| and 
|lightsaillong| instances) that run within a VPC.

|VPC| Requirements for |AC9|
============================

The |VPC| that |AC9| uses requires the following settings. If you're already familiar with these requirements and just want to quickly create
a compatible VPC, skip ahead to :ref:`vpc-settings-create-vpc`.

Use the following checklist to confirm that the VPC meets **all** of the following requirements.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 3 2
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Criteria**
     - **How to confirm**
     - **Additional resources**
   * - The VPC must be in the same AWS account and AWS Region as the |envfirstlong|.
     - :ref:`vpc-settings-requirements-list-vpcs`
     - :ref:`vpc-settings-create-vpc`
   * - The VPC must have a public subnet. (A subnet is public if its traffic is routed to an internet gateway.)

.. note:: For the following procedures, if you use the |VPC| or |EC2| consoles, we recommend you sign in to the |console| and open the |VPC| 
   console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc) or |EC2| console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2) using credentials for an
   |IAM| administrator user in your AWS account. If you use the |cli| or the aws-shell, we recommend you configure the |cli| or the aws-shell with the credentials for 
   an |IAM| administrator user in your AWS account. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator.

.. _vpc-settings-requirements-list-vpcs:

View a List of VPCs For an AWS Region
-------------------------------------

To use the |VPC| console, in the AWS navigation bar, choose the AWS Region that |AC9| will create the |env| in. Then choose :guilabel:`Your VPCs` in the navigation pane.

To use the |CLI| or the aws-shell, run the |EC2| :command:`describe-vpcs` command, for example as follows.

.. code-block:: sh 

   aws ec2 describe-vpcs --output table --query 'Vpcs[*].VpcId' --region us-east-2

In the preceding command, replace :code:`us-east-2` with the AWS Region that |AC9| will create the |env| in. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotes with 
double quotes. To run the preceding command with the aws-shell, omit :code:`aws`.

The output contains the list of VPC IDs.

.. _vpc-settings-requirements-subnets-view:

View a List of Subnets for a VPC
--------------------------------

To use the |VPC| console, choose :guilabel:`Your VPCs` in the navigation pane. Note the VPC's ID in the :guilabel:`VPC ID` column. Then choose :guilabel:`Subnets` 
in the navigation pane, and look for subnets that contain that ID in the :guilabel:`VPC` column.

To use the |CLI| or the aws-shell, run the |EC2| :command:`describe-subnets` command, for example as follows.

.. code-block:: sh 

   aws ec2 describe-subnets --output table --query 'Subnets[*].[SubnetId,VpcId]' --region us-east-2

In the preceding command, replace :code:`us-east-2` with the AWS Region that contains the subnets. To run the preceding command in Windows, replace the single quotes with 
double quotes. To run the preceding command with the aws-shell, omit :code:`aws`.

In the output, look for subnets that match the VPC's ID.

.. _vpc-settings-requirements-subnet-public:

Confirm Whether a Subnet is Public

.. _vpc-settings-requirements-traffic-settings:

Minimum Inbound and Outbound Traffic Settings for |AC9|
-------------------------------------------------------

* **Inbound**: All IP addresses using SSH over port 22. However, you can restrict these IP addresses to only those that |AC9| uses. For more information, see 
  :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>`.

  .. note:: For |envec2plural| created on or after July 31 2018, |AC9| uses security groups to automatically restrict inbound IP addresses using SSH over port 22 to only those addresses that |AC9| uses. 
     For more information, see :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>`.

* **Inbound (network ACLs only)**: For |envec2plural|, and for |envsshplural| associated with |EC2| instances running Amazon Linux, all IP addresses using TCP over ports 32768-61000. 
  For more information, and for port ranges for other |EC2| instance types, see :vpc-user-guide:`Ephemeral Ports <VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports>` in the |VPC-ug|.
* **Outbound**: All traffic sources using any protocol and port.

You can set this behavior at the security group level. For an additional level of security, you can also use a network ACL. For more information, 
see :vpc-user-guide:`Comparison of Security Groups and Network ACLs <VPC_Security.html#VPC_Security_Comparison>` in the |VPC-ug|.

For example, to add inbound and outbound rules to a security group, you could set up those rules as follows.
   
Inbound rules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 1 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Type**
     - **Protocol**
     - **Port Range**
     - **Source**
   * - SSH (22)
     - TCP (6)
     - 22
     - 0.0.0.0 
       (But see the following note and :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>`.)

.. note:: For |envec2plural| created on or after July 31 2018, |AC9| automatically adds an inbound rule to restrict inbound IP addresses using SSH over port 22 to only those addresses that |AC9| uses. 
   For more information, see :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>`.

Outbound rules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 1 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Type**
     - **Protocol**
     - **Port Range**
     - **Source**
   * - ALL Traffic
     - ALL
     - ALL
     - 0.0.0.0/0
   
If you also choose to add inbound and outbound rules to a network ACL, you could set up those rules as follows.

Inbound rules:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 1 1 1 1
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Rule #**

Create an |VPC| for |AC9|
=========================

You can use the |VPC| console to create an |VPC| that is compatible with |AC9|.

.. note:: For this procedure, we recommend you sign in to the |console| and open the |VPC| console using credentials for an |IAM|
   administrator user in your AWS account. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator.

   Some organizations may not allow you to create VPCs on your own. If you cannot create a VPC, check with your AWS account administrator or network administrator.

#. If the |VPC| console isn't already open, sign in to the |console| and open the |VPC| console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc.
#. In the navigation bar, if the AWS Region isn't the same as the |env|, choose
   the correct AWS Region.
#. Choose :guilabel:`VPC Dashboard` in
   the navigation pane, if the :guilabel:`VPC Dashboard` page isn't already displayed.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Launch VPC Wizard`.
#. For :guilabel:`Step 1: Select a VPC Configuration`, with :guilabel:`VPC with a Single Public Subnet` already selected, choose :guilabel:`Select`.
#. For :guilabel:`Step 2: VPC with a Single Public Subnet`, we recommend that you leave the following default settings. (However, you can change the CIDR settings if
   you have custom CIDRs you want to use. For more information, see :vpc-user-guide:`VPC and Subnet Sizing <VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing>` in the |VPC-ug|.)

   * :guilabel:`IPv4 CIDR block`: :guilabel:`10.0.0.0/16`
   * :guilabel:`IPv6 CIDR block`: :guilabel:`No IPv6 CIDR Block`
   * :guilabel:`Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR`: :guilabel:`10.0.0.0/24`
   * :guilabel:`Availability Zone`: :guilabel:`No Preference`
   * :guilabel:`Enable DNS hostnames`: :guilabel:`Yes`
   * :guilabel:`Hardware tenancy`: :guilabel:`Default`

#. For :guilabel:`VPC name`, type a name for the VPC.
#. For :guilabel:`Subnet name`, type a name for the subnet in the VPC.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Create new VPC`.

   |VPC| creates the following resources that are compatible with |AC9|:

   * A VPC.
   * A public subnet for the VPC.
   * A route table for the public subnet with the minimum required settings.
   * An internet gateway for the public subnet.
   * A network ACL for the public subnet with the minimum required settings.

#. By default, the VPC allows incoming traffic from all types, protocols, ports, and IP addresses. 
   You can restrict this behavior to allow only IP addresses coming from |AC9| using SSH over port 22. One approach is to 
   set incoming rules on the VPC's default network ACL, as follows.

   #. In the navigation pane of the |VPC| console, choose :guilabel:`Your VPCs`.
   #. Select the box for the VPC you just created.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Summary` tab, choose the link next to :guilabel:`Network ACL`.
   #. Select the box next to the network ACL that is displayed.
   #. On the :guilabel:`Inbound Rules` tab, choose :guilabel:`Edit`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Rule # 100`, for :guilabel:`Type`, choose :guilabel:`SSH (22)`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Source`, type one of the CIDR blocks in the :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>` list that matches the AWS Region for this VPC.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Add another rule`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Rule #`, type :code:`200`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Type`, choose :guilabel:`SSH (22)`. 
   #. For :guilabel:`Source`, type the other CIDR block in the :ref:`Inbound SSH IP Address Ranges <ip-ranges>` list that matches the AWS Region for this VPC.
   #. At minimum, you must also allow incoming traffic from all IP addresses using TCP over ports 32768-61000 for Amazon Linux instance types. 
      (For background, and for port ranges for other |EC2| instance types, see :vpc-user-guide:`Ephemeral Ports <VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports>` in the |VPC-ug|). To do this, choose :guilabel:`Add another rule`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Rule #`, type :code:`300`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Type`, choose :guilabel:`Custom TCP Rule`.
   #. For :guilabel:`Port Range`, type :code:`32768-61000` (for Amazon Linux instance types).
   #. For :guilabel:`Source`, type :code:`0.0.0.0/0`.
   #. Choose :guilabel:`Save`.
   #. You might need to add more inbound or outbound rules to the network ACL, depending on how you plan to use |AC9|. See the documentation for the 
      web services or APIs you want to allow to communicate into or out of the VPC for the :guilabel:`Type`, :guilabel:`Protocol`, :guilabel:`Port Range`, 
      and :guilabel:`Source` values to specify for these rules.

.. _vpc-settings-create-subnet:

Create a Subnet for |AC9|
=========================

You can use the |VPC| console to create a subnet for a VPC that is compatible with |AC9|.

If you followed the previous procedure to create a VPC for |AC9|, you do not also need to follow this procedure. This is because the :guilabel:`Create new VPC` wizard creates a subnet for you 
automatically.

.. important::

   * The AWS account must already have a compatible VPC in the same AWS Region for the |env|. For
     more information, see the VPC requirements in :ref:`vpc-settings-requirements`.
   * For this procedure, we recommend you sign in to the |console|, and then open the |VPC| console using
     credentials for an |IAM|
     administrator user in your AWS account. If you can't do this, check with your AWS account administrator.
   * Some organizations may not allow you to create subnets on your own. If you cannot create a subnet, check with your AWS account administrator or network administrator.

#. If the |VPC| console isn't already open, sign in to the |console| and open the |VPC| console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc.
#. In the navigation bar, if the AWS Region isn't the same as the AWS Region for the |env|, choose
   the correct AWS Region.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Subnets` in the navigation
   pane, if the :guilabel:`Subnets` page isn't already displayed.
#. Choose :guilabel:`Create Subnet`.
#. In the :guilabel:`Create Subnet` dialog box, for :guilabel:`Name tag`, type a name for the subnet.
#. For :guilabel:`VPC`, choose the VPC to associate the subnet with.
#. For :guilabel:`Availability Zone`, choose the Availability Zone within the AWS Region for the subnet to use, or choose :guilabel:`No Preference` to let AWS choose an Availability Zone for you.
#. For :guilabel:`IPv4 CIDR block`, type the range of IP addresses for the subnet to use, in CIDR format. This range of IP addresses must be a subset of IP addresses in the VPC.

   For information about CIDR blocks, see :vpc-user-guide:`VPC and Subnet Sizing <VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing>` in the |VPC-ug|.
   See also `3.1. Basic Concept and Prefix Notation <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632#section-3.1>`_ in RFC 4632 or
   `IPv4 CIDR blocks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks>`_ in Wikipedia.

#. After you create the subnet, be sure to associate it with a compatible route table and an internet gateway, as well as security groups, a network ACL, or both. For more information, see the requirements in :ref:`vpc-settings-requirements`.
